abstract = {Recent findings suggest that wall-bounded turbulent flow can take different statistically stationary turbulent states, with different transport properties, even for the very same values of the control parameters. What state the system takes depends on the initial conditions. Here we analyze the multiple states in large-aspect ratio ({\$}\backslashGamma{\$}) two-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh--B$\backslash$'enard flow with no-slip plates and horizontally periodic boundary conditions as model system. We determine the number {\$}n{\$} of convection rolls, their mean aspect ratios {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}r = \backslashGamma /n{\$}, and the corresponding transport properties of the flow (i.e., the Nusselt number {\$}Nu{\$}), as function of the control parameters Rayleigh ({\$}Ra{\$}) and Prandtl number.

abstract = {The motion induced in a layer of Boussinesq fluid by moving periodic thermal waves is obtained by numerically solving the complete nonlinear two-dimensional momentum and temperature equations. Three sets of boundary conditions are treated: rigid upper and lower boundaries with symmetrical heating; free upper boundary and rigid lower boundary with heating only at the top; free upper and lower boundaries with symmetrical heating. The nonlinear streamline patterns show that, when the velocity fluctuations are larger than the phase speed of the thermal wave and the mean flow, the convection cells have shapes governed by fluctuating nonlinear interactions. Significant mean velocities can be created even without the characteristic tilt in the convection cells expected on the basis of linear theory. Nonlinear interactions can lead to a mean shear even in the absence of motion of the thermal source. When the viscous diffusion time across the fluid layer is less than or of the same order as the period of the thermal wave, the order of magnitude of the induced mean velocity does not exceed that of the phase speed of the wave, even for intense thermal forcing. {\textcopyright} 1972, Cambridge University Press.

The Rayleigh number, which is determined by the superimposed temperature difference and the cylinder diameter, varies within the range . It is shown that the convective heat transfer along the cylinder is most effective in the inclined cylinder, where an intense large-scale circulation exists on a background of developed small-scale turbulence. In the horizontal cylinder, the turbulence is weak, but the large-scale circulation provides moderate heat transfer. In the vertical cylinder, the large-scale circulation is absent, the turbulent fluctuations are most active, but the heat transfer is the weakest. The dependence of the Nusselt number on the Rayleigh and the Prandtl numbers, and the dependence of the Reynolds number on the Grashof number are shown and discussed.},

The mathematical model includes the two-dimensional momentum and induction equations for a fully developed flow and the three-dimensional (3-D) energy equation. Two FCI modifications, one with no pressure equalization openings and one with a pressure equalization slot, have been considered. The computations were performed in a parametric form, using the electric and thermal conductivity of the SiCf/SiC as parameters. Under the DEMO reactor conditions, parameters of the FCI have been identified that result in low MHD pressure drop and low heat leakage from the breeder into the helium flows. This paper also discusses the role of the pressure equalization openings, 3-D flow effects, and the effect of SiCf/SiC anisotropy.},

abstract = {We studied the properties of the large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard (RB) convection by using results from direct numerical simulations in which we placed a large number of numerical probes close to the sidewall. The LSC orientation is determined by either a cosine or a polynomial fit to the azimuthal temperature or azimuthal vertical velocity profile measured with the probes. We study the LSC in $\Gamma$ = D/L = 1/2 and $\Gamma$ = 1 samples, where D is the diameter and L is the height. For Pr = 6.4 in an aspect ratio $\Gamma$ = 1 sample at Ra = 1 × 108 and 5 × 108, the obtained LSC orientation is the same, irrespective of whether the data of only 8 or all 64 probes per horizontal plane are considered. In a $\Gamma$ = 1/2 sample with Pr = 0.7 at Ra = 1 × 108, the influence of plumes on the azimuthal temperature and azimuthal vertical velocity profiles is stronger. Due to passing plumes and/or the corner flow, the apparent LSC orientation obtained using a cosine fit can result in a misinterpretation of the character of the large-scale flow. We introduce the relative LSC strength, which we define as the ratio between the energy in the first Fourier mode and the energy in all modes that can be determined from the azimuthal temperature and azimuthal vertical velocity profiles, to further quantify the large-scale flow. For Ra = 1 × 108, we find that this relative LSC strength is significantly lower in a $\Gamma$ = 1/2 sample than in a $\Gamma$ = 1 sample, reflecting that the LSC is much more pronounced in a $\Gamma$ = 1 sample than in a $\Gamma$ = 1/2 sample. The determination of the relative LSC strength can be applied directly to available experimental data to study high Rayleigh number thermal convection and rotating RB convection. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements (aSPEM) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of aSPEM, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of aSPEM is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

abstract = {Thermal convection driven by internal heat sources and sinks was recently shown experimentally to exhibit the mixing-length or "ultimate" scaling-regime: The Nusselt number Nu (dimensionless heat flux) increases as the square-root of the Rayleigh-number Ra (dimensionless internal temperature difference). While for standard Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection this scaling regime was proven to be a rigorous upper bound on the Nusselt number, we show that this is not so for convection driven by internal sources and sinks. To wit, we introduce an asymptotic expansion to derive steady nonlinear solutions in the limit of large RaQ, the Rayleigh-number based on the strength of the heat source. We illustrate this procedure for a simple sinusoidal heat source and show that it achieves heat transport enhancement beyond the mixing-length scaling regime: Nu increases linearly with Ra over this branch of solutions. Using rigorous upper bound theory, we prove that the scaling regime Nu∼Ra of the asymptotic solution corresponds to a maximization of the heat flux subject to simple dynamical constraints, up to a dimensionless prefactor. Not only do two-dimensional numerical simulations confirm the analytical solution for the sinusoidal source, but, more surprisingly, they indicate that it is stable and indeed achieved by the system up to the highest RaQ investigated numerically, with a heat transport efficiency orders of magnitude higher than the standard mixing-length estimate.},

abstract = {The absorption of light or radiation drives turbulent convection inside stars, supernovae, frozen lakes, and Earth's mantle. In these contexts, the goal of laboratory and numerical studies is to determine the relation between the internal temperature gradients and the heat flux transported by the turbulent flow. This is the constitutive law of turbulent convection, to be input into large-scale models of such natural flows. However, in contrast with the radiative heating of natural flows, laboratory experiments have focused on convection driven by heating and cooling plates; the heat transport is then severely restricted by boundary layers near the plates, which prevents the realization of the mixing length scaling law used in evolution models of geophysical and astrophysical flows. There is therefore an important discrepancy between the scaling laws measured in laboratory experiments and those used, e.g., in stellar evolution models. Here we provide experimental and numerical evidence that radiatively driven convection spontaneously achieves the mixing length scaling regime, also known as the “ultimate” regime of thermal convection. This constitutes a clear observation of this regime of turbulent convection. Our study therefore bridges the gap between models of natural flows and laboratory experiments. It opens an experimental avenue for a priori determinations of the constitutive laws to be implemented into models of geophysical and astrophysical flows, as opposed to empirical fits of these constitutive laws to the scarce observational data.},

abstract = {The mean state of the atmosphere and ocean is set through a balance between external forcing (radiation, winds, heat and freshwater fluxes) and the emergent turbulence, which transfers energy to dissipative structures. The forcing gives rise to jets in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean, which spontaneously develop turbulent eddies through the baroclinic instability. A critical step in the development of a theory of climate is to properly include the eddy-induced turbulent transport of properties like heat, moisture, and carbon. In the linear stages, baroclinic instability generates flow structures at the Rossby deformation radius, a length scale of order 1,000 km in the atmosphere and 100 km in the ocean, smaller than the planetary scale and the typical extent of ocean basins, respectively. There is, therefore, a separation of scales between the large-scale gradient of properties like temperature and the smaller eddies that advect it randomly, inducing effective diffusion. Numerical solutions show that such scale separation remains in the strongly nonlinear turbulent regime, provided there is sufficient drag at the bottom of the atmosphere and ocean. We compute the scaling laws governing the eddy-driven transport associated with baroclinic turbulence. First, we provide a theoretical underpinning for empirical scaling laws reported in previous studies, for different formulations of the bottom drag law. Second, these scaling laws are shown to provide an important first step toward an accurate local closure to predict the impact of baroclinic turbulence in setting the large-scale temperature profiles in the atmosphere and ocean.},

abstract = {We are interested in the approximation of partial differential equations with a data-driven approach based on the reduced basis method and machine learning. We suppose that the phenomenon of interest can be modeled by a parametrized partial differential equation, but that the value of the physical parameters is unknown or difficult to be directly measured. Our method allows to estimate fields of interest, for instance temperature of a sample of material or velocity of a fluid, given data at a handful of points in the domain. We propose to accomplish this task with a neural network embedding a reduced basis solver as exotic activation function in the last layer. The reduced basis solver accounts for the underlying physical phenomenon and it is constructed from snapshots obtained from randomly selected values of the physical parameters during an expensive offline phase. The same full order solutions are then employed for the training of the neural network. As a matter of fact, the chosen architecture resembles an asymmetric autoencoder in which the decoder is the reduced basis solver and as such it does not contain trainable parameters. The resulting latent space of our autoencoder includes parameter-dependent quantities feeding the reduced basis solver, which – depending on the considered partial differential equation – are the values of the physical parameters themselves or the affine decomposition coefficients of the differential operators.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate neural networks applied to multiscale simulations of porous media flows and discuss a design of a novel deep neural network model reduction approach for multiscale problems. Due to the multiscale nature of the medium, the fine-grid resolution gives rise to a huge number of degrees of freedom. In practice, low-order models are derived to reduce the computational cost. In our paper, we use a non-local multicontinuum (NLMC) approach [18], which represents the solution on a coarse grid for porous media flows. In specific, we construct a reduced dimensional space which takes into account multi-continuum information. The numerical solutions are then sought in such space. Using multi-layer learning techniques, we formulate and learn input-output maps constructed with NLMC on a coarse grid. We study the features of the coarse-grid solutions that neural networks capture via relating the input-output optimization to ℓ1 minimization of flow solutions. In proposed multi-layer networks, we can learn the forward operators in a reduced way without computing them as in POD like approaches. We present soft thresholding operators as activation function, which our studies show to have some advantages. With these activation functions, the neural network identifies and selects important multiscale features which are crucial in modeling the underlying flow. Using trained neural network approximation of the input-output map, we construct a reduced-order model for the solution approximation. We use multi-layer networks for the time stepping and reduced-order modeling, where at each time step the appropriate important modes are selected. For a class of nonlinear flow problems, we suggest an efficient strategy. Numerical examples are presented to examine the performance of our method.},

abstract = {Closure modeling based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism has proven effective to improve the stability and accuracy of projection-based model order reduction. However, closure models are often expensive and infeasible for complex nonlinear systems. Towards efficient model reduction of general problems, this paper presents a recurrent neural network (RNN) closure of parametric POD-Galerkin reduced-order model. Based on the short time history of the reduced-order solutions, the RNN predicts the memory integral which represents the impact of the unresolved scales on the resolved scales. A conditioned long short term memory (LSTM) network is utilized as the regression model of the memory integral, in which the POD coefficients at a number of time steps are fed into the LSTM units, and the physical/geometrical parameters are fed into the initial hidden state of the LSTM. The reduced-order model is integrated in time using an implicit-explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta scheme, in which the memory term is integrated explicitly and the remaining right-hand-side term is integrated implicitly to improve the computational efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the RNN closure can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the POD-Galerkin reduced-order model of nonlinear problems. The POD-Galerkin reduced-order model with the RNN closure is also shown to be capable of making accurate predictions, well beyond the time interval of the training data.},

abstract = {Airside turbulent flow structure in a coupled air-water system has been investigated during natural convection. Two-dimensional velocity field in a plane perpendicular to the surface was measured using particle image velocimetry (PIV). The results show the presence of different flow regimes in turbulent velocity fields which increase the complexity of the phenomena. The spectral analysis shows the existence of two power law regimes in the wavenumber spectra of the horizontal and vertical turbulent velocities. The regime at lower wavenumbers exhibits slopes of -3 which correspond to the buoyancy subrange where the energy loss is due to the work against buoyancy. At relatively higher wavenumbers, the inertial subrange with slopes of -5/3 is manifested. The trends of the wavenumber spectra in the present study are similar to the kinetic energy spectra observed in the geophysical studies over land and oceans, which indicates that laboratory experiments could be used to understand the near-surface dynamics in the lower atmosphere.

The instability is discussed in the three different contextsan unbounded strained vortex, a localized strained vortex, and a triaxial ellipsoidwhere it was originally discovered and then rediscovered. These make it clear that the instability is one of parametric resonance where a normal mode, or pair of normal modes, of the undistorted rotating flow resonates with the underlying strain field. The effects of additional physics on the instability process are examined before its nonlinear evolution is discussed. Various applications of the instability in nature are then reviewed.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In this letter we discuss two topics: the breakdown under rotation of the domain-filling large-scale circulation (LSC) typical for confined convection, and the convective heat transfer through the fluid layer, expressed by the Nusselt number. The presence of the LSC is addressed for several rotation rates. For Rossby numbers Ro≲1.2 no LSC is found (the Rossby number indicates relative importance of buoyancy over rotation, hence small Ro indicates strong rotation). For larger Rossby numbers a precession of the LSC in anticyclonic direction (counter to the background rotation) is observed. It is shown that the heat transfer has a maximal value close to Ro=0.18 being about 15{\%} larger than in the non-rotating case Ro=∞. Since the LSC is no longer present at this Rossby value we conclude that the peak heat transfer is independent of the LSC. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 EPLA.},

abstract = {The heat transport and corresponding changes in the large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection are studied by means of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations as a function of the aspect ratio $\gamma$ of a closed cylindrical cell and the Rayleigh number Ra. The Prandtl number is Pr = 0.7 throughout the study. The aspect ratio is varied between 0.5 and 12 for a Rayleigh number range between 107 and 109. The Nusselt number Nu is the dimensionless measure of the global turbulent heat transfer. For small and moderate aspect ratios, the global heat transfer law Nu = A Ra$\beta$ shows a power law dependence of both fit coefficients A and on the aspect ratio. A minimum of Nu($\gamma$) is found at $\gamma$ ≈ 2.5 and $\gamma$ 2.≈25 for Ra = 107 and Ra = 108, respectively. This is the point where the LSC undergoes a transition from a single-roll to a double-roll pattern. With increasing aspect ratio, we detect complex multi-roll LSC configurations in the convection cell. For larger aspect ratios $\gamma$≳ 8, our data indicate that the heat transfer becomes independent of the aspect ratio of the cylindrical cell. The aspect ratio dependence of the turbulent heat transfer for small and moderate $\gamma$ is in line with a varying amount of energy contained in the LSC, as quantified by the Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve or proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis of the turbulent convection field. The POD analysis is conducted here by the snapshot method for at least 100 independent realizations of the turbulent fields. The primary POD mode, which replicates the time-averaged LSC patterns, transports about 50{\%} of the global heat for $\gamma$≥1. The snapshot analysis enables a systematic disentanglement of the contributions of POD modes to the global turbulent heat transfer. Although the smallest scale-the Kolmogorov scale $\eta$K-and the largest scale-the cell height H-are widely separated in a turbulent flow field, the LSC patterns in fully turbulent fields exhibit strikingly similar texture to those in the weakly nonlinear regime right above the onset of convection. Pentagonal or hexagonal circulation cells are observed preferentially if the aspect ratio is sufficiently large ($\gamma$≳8). {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

A one-level separation allows for background (low-rank) and foreground (sparse) separation of dynamical data, or robust principal component analysis. The multiresolution DMD (mrDMD) is capable of characterizing nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner by recursively decomposing the state of the system into low-rank terms whose temporal coefficients in time are known. DMD modes with temporal frequencies near the origin (zero-modes) are interpreted as background (low-rank) portions of the given dynamics, and the terms with temporal frequencies bounded away from the origin are their sparse counterparts. The mrDMD method is demonstrated on several examples involving multiscale dynamical data, showing excellen t decomposition results, including sifting the El Ni{\~{n}}o mode from ocean temperature data. It is further applied to decompose a video data set into separate objects moving at different rates against a slowly varying background. These examples show that the decomposition is an effective dynamical systems tool for data-driven discovery.},

The most energetic modes are characterized by a fundamental time scale in the range 200-300 viscous wall units. The full spatio-temporal decomposition provides a natural measure of the convection velocity of structures, with a characteristic value of 12 in the wall layer.

abstract = {The description of coherent features of fluid flow is essential to our understanding of fluid-dynamical and transport processes. A method is introduced that is able to extract dynamic information from flow fields that are either generated by a (direct) numerical simulation or visualized/measured in a physical experiment. The extracted dynamic modes, which can be interpreted as a generalization of global stability modes, can be used to describe the underlying physical mechanisms captured in the data sequence or to project large-scale problems onto a dynamical system of significantly fewer degrees of freedom. The concentration on subdomains of the flow field where relevant dynamics is expected allows the dissection of a complex flow into regions of localized instability phenomena and further illustrates the flexibility of the method, as does the description of the dynamics within a spatial framework. Demonstrations of the method are presented consisting of a plane channel flow, flow over a two-dimensional cavity, wake flow behind a flexible membrane and a jet passing between two cylinders. {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {We consider the frequency domain form of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), called spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). Spectral POD is derived from a space-time POD problem for statistically stationary flows and leads to modes that each oscillate at a single frequency. This form of POD goes back to the original work of Lumley (Stochastic Tools in Turbulence, Academic Press, 1970), but has been overshadowed by a space-only form of POD since the 1990s. We clarify the relationship between these two forms of POD and show that SPOD modes represent structures that evolve coherently in space and time, while space-only POD modes in general do not. We also establish a relationship between SPOD and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD); we show that SPOD modes are in fact optimally averaged DMD modes obtained from an ensemble DMD problem for stationary flows. Accordingly, SPOD modes represent structures that are dynamic in the same sense as DMD modes but also optimally account for the statistical variability of turbulent flows. Finally, we establish a connection between SPOD and resolvent analysis. The key observation is that the resolvent-mode expansion coefficients must be regarded as statistical quantities to ensure convergent approximations of the flow statistics. When the expansion coefficients are uncorrelated, we show that SPOD and resolvent modes are identical. Our theoretical results and the overall utility of SPOD are demonstrated using two example problems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a turbulent jet.},

This problem is mostly transformed into finding the sub-pixel peak in a correlation map. To address the original displacement extraction problem, we propose a different evaluation scheme (PIV-DCNN) with four-level regression deep convolutional neural networks. At each level, the networks are trained to predict a vector from two input image patches. The low-level network is skilled at large displacement estimation and the high- level networks are devoted to improving the accuracy. Outlier replacement and symmetric window offset operation glue the well- functioning networks in a cascaded manner. Through comparison with the standard PIV methods (one-pass cross-correlation method, three-pass window deformation), the practicability of the proposed PIV-DCNN is verified by the application to a diversity of synthetic and experimental PIV images.},

Two machine learning models are developed, namely, the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the hybrid downsampled skip-connection/multi-scale (DSC/MS) models. These machine learning models are applied to a two-dimensional cylinder wake as a preliminary test and show remarkable ability to reconstruct laminar flow from low-resolution flow field data. We further assess the performance of these models for two-dimensional homogeneous turbulence. The CNN and DSC/MS models are found to reconstruct turbulent flows from extremely coarse flow field images with remarkable accuracy. For the turbulent flow problem, the machine-leaning-based super-resolution analysis can greatly enhance the spatial resolution with as little as 50 training snapshot data, holding great potential to reveal subgrid-scale physics of complex turbulent flows. With the growing availability of flow field data from high-fidelity simulations and experiments, the present approach motivates the development of effective super-resolution models for a variety of fluid flows.},

abstract = {An artificial intelligence (AI) control system is developed to maximize the mixing rate of a turbulent jet. This system comprises of six independently operated unsteady minijet actuators, two hot-wire sensors placed in the jet and genetic programming for the unsupervised learning of a near-optimal control law. The ansatz of this law includes multi-frequency open-loop forcing, sensor feedback and nonlinear combinations thereof. Mixing performance is quantified by the decay rate of the centreline mean velocity of the jet. Intriguingly, the learning process of AI control discovers the classical forcings, i.e. axisymmetric, helical and flapping achievable from conventional control techniques, one by one in the order of increased performance, and finally converges to a hitherto unexplored forcing. Careful examination of the control landscape unveils typical control laws, generated in the learning process, and their evolutions. The best AI forcing produces a complex turbulent flow structure that is characterized by periodically generated mushroom structures, helical motion and an oscillating jet column, all enhancing the mixing rate and vastly outperforming others. Being never reported before, this flow structure is examined in various aspects, including the velocity spectra, mean and fluctuating velocity fields and their downstream evolution, and flow visualization images in three orthogonal planes, all compared with other classical flow structures. Along with the knowledge of the minijet-produced flow and its effect on the initial condition of the main jet, these aspects cast valuable insight into the physics behind the highly effective mixing of this newly found flow structure. The results point to the great potential of AI in conquering the vast opportunity space of control laws for many actuators and sensors and in optimizing turbulence.},

abstract = {Fish in schooling formations navigate complex flow fields replete with mechanical energy in the vortex wakes of their companions. Their schooling behavior has been associated with evolutionary advantages including energy savings, yet the underlying physical mechanisms remain unknown. We show that fish can improve their sustained propulsive efficiency by placing themselves in appropriate locations in the wake of other swimmers and intercepting judiciously their shed vortices. This swimming strategy leads to collective energy savings and is revealed through a combination of high-fidelity flow simulations with a deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. The RL algorithm relies on a policy defined by deep, recurrent neural nets, with long–short-term memory cells, that are essential for capturing the unsteadiness of the two-way interactions between the fish and the vortical flow field. Surprisingly, we find that swimming in-line with a leader is not associated with energetic benefits for the follower. Instead, “smart swimmer(s)” place themselves at off-center positions, with respect to the axis of the leader(s) and deform their body to synchronize with the momentum of the oncoming vortices, thus enhancing their swimming efficiency at no cost to the leader(s). The results confirm that fish may harvest energy deposited in vortices and support the conjecture that swimming in formation is energetically advantageous. Moreover, this study demonstrates that deep RL can produce navigation algorithms for complex unsteady and vortical flow fields, with promising implications for energy savings in autonomous robotic swarms.},

abstract = {We propose a modeling paradigm, termed field inversion and machine learning (FIML), that seeks to comprehensively harness data from sources such as high-fidelity simulations and experiments to aid the creation of improved closure models for computational physics applications. In contrast to inferring model parameters, this work uses inverse modeling to obtain corrective, spatially distributed functional terms, offering a route to directly address model-form errors. Once the inference has been performed over a number of problems that are representative of the deficient physics in the closure model, machine learning techniques are used to reconstruct the model corrections in terms of variables that appear in the closure model. These reconstructed functional forms are then used to augment the closure model in a predictive computational setting. As a first demonstrative example, a scalar ordinary differential equation is considered, wherein the model equation has missing and deficient terms. Following this, the methodology is extended to the prediction of turbulent channel flow. In both of these applications, the approach is demonstrated to be able to successfully reconstruct functional corrections and yield accurate predictive solutions while providing a measure of model form uncertainties.},

Our approach has been demonstrated using both residual formula and backward difference scheme formulas. However, it can be easily generalized into many different numerical schemes as well. We give a demonstration of our framework for three examples: (i) Kraichnan-Orszag system, an illustrative coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equation, (ii) Lorenz system exhibiting chaotic behavior, and (iii) a nonintrusive model order reduction framework for the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with a differentially heated cavity flow setup at various Rayleigh numbers. Using only snapshots of state variables at discrete time instances, our data-driven approach can be considered truly nonintrusive since any prior information about the underlying governing equations is not required for generating the reduced order model. Our a posteriori analysis shows that the proposed data-driven approach is remarkably accurate and can be used as a robust predictive tool for nonintrusive model order reduction of complex fluid flows.},

The proposed method is applied to a flow around a circular cylinder at the Reynolds number    {\$}Re{\_}{\{}D{\}}=100{\$}   as a test case. The flow attributes are mapped into two modes in the latent space and then these two modes are visualized in the physical space. Because the MD-CNN-AEs with nonlinear activation functions show lower reconstruction errors than the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), the nonlinearity contained in the activation function is considered the key to improving the capability of the model. It is found by applying POD to each field decomposed using the MD-CNN-AE with hyperbolic tangent activation such that a single nonlinear MD-CNN-AE mode contains multiple orthogonal bases, in contrast to the linear methods, i.e. POD and MD-CNN-AE with linear activation. We further assess the proposed MD-CNN-AE by applying it to a transient process of a circular cylinder wake in order to examine its capability for flows containing high-order spatial modes. The present results suggest a great potential for the nonlinear MD-CNN-AE to be used for feature extraction of flow fields in lower dimensions than POD, while retaining interpretable relationships with the conventional POD modes. },

abstract = {     With the recent rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and wide applications in many areas, some fundamental questions in turbulence research can be addressed, such as: ‘Can turbulence be learned by AI? If so, how and why?' In order to provide answers to these questions, we applied deep learning to the prediction of turbulent heat transfer based only on wall information using data obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flow. Through this attempt, we investigated whether deep learning could help to improve our understanding of the physics of turbulent heat transfer. Under the assumption that the wall-normal local heat flux can be explicitly expressed through a multilayer nonlinear network in terms of the nearby wall-shear stresses and wall pressure fluctuations, we applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict the local heat flux. After optimizing the network hyperparameters using a grid searching method, we found that the network can predict the heat flux very accurately with a correlation coefficient of 0.980 between the DNS and the prediction by CNN for the trained Reynolds number,    {\$}Re{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D70F{\}}{\}}=180{\$}   , and shows similar accuracy at a Reynolds number three times higher than the trained number. This result indicates that relationships between the local heat flux and the nearby inputs are quite insensitive to the Reynolds number within the tested range. In addition, observing the gradient maps of the trained network, we identified the part of the input data that is essential for the local heat flux prediction and the spatial relationship between the local heat flux and the nearby input fields. In addition to obtaining an understanding of the underlying physics, we investigated whether our model could be utilized for turbulence modelling. },

abstract = {In recent years, the data-driven turbulence model has attracted widespread concern in fluid mechanics. The existing approaches modify or supplement the original turbulence model by machine learning based on the experimental/numerical data, in order to augment the capability of the present turbulence models. Different from the previous researches, this paper directly reconstructs a mapping function between the turbulent eddy viscosity and the mean flow variables by neural networks and completely replaces the original partial differential equation model. On the other hand, compared with the machine learning models for the low Reynolds (Re) number flows based on direct numerical simulation data, high Reynolds number flows around airfoils present the apparent scaling effects and strong anisotropy, which induce large challenges in accuracy and generalization capability for the machine learning algorithm. We mainly concentrate on the high Reynolds number turbulent flows around the airfoils and take the results calculated by the computational fluid dynamics solver with the Spallart-Allmaras (SA) model as training data to construct a high-dimensional data-driven network model based on machine learning. The radial basis function neural network and the auxiliary optimization methods are adopted, and the individual models are built separately for the flow fields of the near-wall region, wake region, and far-field region. The training data in this paper is extracted from only three subsonic flow fields of NACA0012 airfoil. The data-driven turbulence model can be applied to various airfoils and flow states, and the predicted eddy viscosity, lift/drag coefficients, and skin friction distributions are all in good agreement with the results of the original SA model. This research demonstrates the promising prospect of machine learning methods in future studies about turbulence modeling.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the time-resolved turbulent flow reconstruction from discrete point measurements and non-time-resolved (non-TR) particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements using an artificial intelligence framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM). To this end, an LSTM-based proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) model is proposed to establish the relationship between velocity signals and time-varying POD coefficients obtained from non-TR-PIV measurements. An inverted flag flow at Re = 6200 was experimentally measured using TR-PIV at a sampling rate of 2000 Hz for the construction of training and testing datasets and for validation. Two different time-step configurations were employed to investigate the robustness and learning ability of the LSTM-based POD model: a single-time-step structure and a multi-time-step structure. The results demonstrate that the LSTM-based POD model has great potential for time-series reconstruction since it can successfully recover the temporal revolution of POD coefficients with remarkable accuracy, even in high-order POD modes. The time-resolved flow fields can be reconstructed well using coefficients obtained from the proposed model. In addition, a relative error reconstruction analysis was conducted to compare the performance of different time-step configurations further, and the results demonstrated that the POD model with multi-time-step structure provided better reconstruction of the flow fields.},

abstract = {Vortex-induced vibrations of bluff bodies occur when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure. Of interest is the prediction of the lift and drag forces on the structure given some limited and scattered information on the velocity field. This is an inverse problem that is not straightforward to solve using standard computational fluid dynamics methods, especially since no information is provided for the pressure. An even greater challenge is to infer the lift and drag forces given some dye or smoke visualizations of the flow field. Here we employ deep neural networks that are extended to encode the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the structure's dynamic motion equation. In the first case, given scattered data in space-time on the velocity field and the structure's motion, we use four coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the structural parameters, the entire time-dependent pressure field (with no prior training data), and reconstruct the velocity vector field and the structure's dynamic motion. In the second case, given scattered data in space-time on a concentration field only, we use five coupled deep neural networks to infer very accurately the vector velocity field and all other quantities of interest as before. This new paradigm of inference in fluid mechanics for coupled multi-physics problems enables velocity and pressure quantification from flow snapshots in small subdomains and can be exploited for flow control applications and also for system identification.},

abstract = {In this paper, a data driven approach is presented for the prediction of incompressible laminar steady flow field over airfoils based on the combination of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and deep Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The flow field over an airfoil depends on the airfoil geometry, Reynolds number, and angle of attack. In conventional approaches, Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are solved on a computational mesh with corresponding boundary conditions to obtain the flow solutions, which is a time consuming task. In the present approach, the flow field over an airfoil is approximated as a function of airfoil geometry, Reynolds number, and angle of attack using deep neural networks without solving the NS equations. The present approach consists of two steps. First, CNN is employed to extract the geometrical parameters from airfoil shapes. Then, the extracted geometrical parameters along with Reynolds number and angle of attack are fed as input to the MLP network to obtain an approximate model to predict the flow field. The required database for the network training is generated using the OpenFOAM solver by solving NS equations. Once the training is done, the flow field around an airfoil can be obtained in seconds. From the prediction results, it is evident that the approach is efficient and accurate.},

@article{Shahane2019,
abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of input uncertainties on the outputs of a three dimensional natural convection problem in a differentially heated cubical enclosure. Two different cases are considered for parameter uncertainty propagation and global sensitivity analysis. In case A, stochastic variation is introduced in the two non-dimensional parameters (Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers) with an assumption that the boundary temperature is uniform. Being a two dimensional stochastic problem, the polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) method is used as a surrogate model. Case B deals with non-uniform stochasticity in the boundary temperature. Instead of the traditional Gaussian process model with the Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve expansion, a novel approach is successfully implemented to model uncertainty in the boundary condition. The boundary is divided into multiple domains and the temperature imposed on each domain is assumed to be an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) random variable. Deep neural networks are trained with the boundary temperatures as inputs and Nusselt number, internal temperature or velocities as outputs. The number of domains which is essentially the stochastic dimension is 4, 8, 16 or 32. Rigorous training and testing process shows that the neural network is able to approximate the outputs to a reasonable accuracy. For a high stochastic dimension such as 32, it is computationally expensive to fit the PCE. This paper demonstrates a novel way of using the deep neural network as a surrogate modeling method for uncertainty quantification with the number of simulations much fewer than that required for fitting the PCE, thus, saving the computational cost.},

By interacting with the unsteady wake, the artificial neural network successfully stabilizes the vortex alley and reduces drag by approximately 8 {\%}. This is performed while using small mass flow rates for the actuation, of the order of 0.5 {\%} of the mass flow rate intersecting the cylinder cross-section once a new pseudo-periodic shedding regime is found.

Fluid Mech. 865, 281-302 (2019)]. However, while promising results were obtained on a simple 2-dimensional benchmark flow at a moderate Reynolds number, considerable speedups will be required to investigate more challenging flow configurations. In the case of DRL trained with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than training the artificial neural network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution. Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches. The first one, which is well documented in the literature, is to parallelize the numerical simulation itself. The second one is to adapt the DRL algorithm for parallelization. Here, a simple strategy is to use several independent simulations running in parallel to collect experiences faster. In the present work, we discuss this solution for parallelization. We illustrate that perfect speedups can be obtained up to the batch size of the DRL agent, and slightly suboptimal scaling still takes place for an even larger number of simulations. This is, therefore, an important step toward enabling the study of more sophisticated fluid mechanics problems through DRL.},

Key objectives of this paper are: (a) Investigate how a deep recurrent neural network model performs in predicting heating demand in campus buildings at University of Utah over multiple weeks, and (b) develop an optimization framework that which can provide definitive guidelines on sizing a stratified thermal storage tank without requiring high performance computing resources. The results showed that the predictions by the deep RNN are comparatively more accurate than those by a 3-layer MLP, and that these deep RNN predictions can adequately serve as proxy for future demand while considering sizing in the design of a complementary stratified thermal storage tank.},

Our analysis is based on a direct numerical simulation of Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection in a closed cylindrical cell of aspect ratio $\Gamma$=1 and focused on the critical points of the skin friction field. We identify triplets of critical points, which are composed of two unstable nodes and a saddle between them, as the characteristic building block of the skin friction field. Isolated triplets as well as networks of triplets are detected. The majority of the ridges of linelike thermal plumes coincide with the unstable manifolds of the saddles. From a dynamical Lagrangian perspective, thermal plumes are formed together with an attractive hyperbolic Lagrangian coherent structure of the skin friction field. We also discuss the differences from the skin friction field in turbulent channel flows from the perspective of the Poincar{\'{e}}-Hopf index theorem for two-dimensional vector fields.},

We consider convection in a cylindrical cell at aspect ratio one for Rayleigh numbers of Ra= 3× 109 and 3× 1010 at fixed Prandtl number Pr= 0. 7. Similar to the experimental results in the same setup and for the same Prandtl number, the structure of the laminar boundary layers of the velocity and temperature fields is found to deviate from the prediction of Prandtl-Blasius-Pohlhausen theory. Deviations decrease when a dynamical rescaling of the data with an instantaneously defined boundary layer thickness is performed and the analysis plane is aligned with the instantaneous direction of the large-scale circulation in the closed cell. Our numerical results demonstrate that important assumptions of existing classical laminar boundary layer theories for forced and natural convection are violated, such as the strict two-dimensionality of the dynamics or the steadiness of the fluid motion. The boundary layer dynamics consists of two essential local dynamical building blocks, a plume detachment and a post-plume phase. The former is associated with larger variations of the instantaneous thickness of velocity and temperature boundary layer and a fully three-dimensional local flow. The post-plume dynamics is connected with the large-scale circulation in the cell that penetrates the boundary region from above. The mean turbulence profiles taken in localized sections of the boundary layer for each dynamical phase are also compared with solutions of perturbation expansions of the boundary layer equations of forced or natural convection towards mixed convection. Our analysis of both boundary layers shows that the near-wall dynamics combines elements of forced Blasius-type and natural convection. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

The apparatus is essentially the same as that used by Niemela et al. (2000), except that the height was halved. The measurement techniques were also identical but the mean temperature of the flow was held fixed for all Rayleigh numbers. The highest Rayleigh number was 2 × 1015. Together with existing data, the new measurements are analysed with the purpose of understanding the relation between the Nusselt number and the Rayleigh number, when the latter is large. In particular, the roles played by Prandtl number, aspect ratio, mean wind, boundary layers, sidewalls, and non-Boussinesq effects are discussed. Nusselt numbers, measured at the highest Rayleigh numbers for which Boussinesq conditions hold and sidewall forcing is negligible, are shown to vary approximately as a 1/3-power of the Rayleigh number. Much of the complexity in interpreting experimental data appears to arise from aspects of the mean flow, including complex coupling of its dynamics to sidewall boundary conditions of the container. Despite the obvious practical difficulties, we conclude that the next generation of experiments will be considerably more useful if they focus on large aspect ratios.},

abstract = {We obtain exact solutions of the linearized perturbation equations for the convective motions in a Boussinesq fluid contained in an infinite rectangular channel and heated from below. The top and bottom are assumed to be perfect heat conductors. The sides can either be conducting or insulating. We assume that the sidewalls are rigid, but allow the top and bottom to be free so that we can separate variables. We find that the preferred modes of convection closely resemble transverse ‘finite rolls' [as predicted by Davis (1967) for convection in a box] for channels with height to width ratios outside the range 0{\textperiodcentered}1 to 1. Inside this range they show noticeable departures from roll form. We prove, however, that, except when the sidewalls are relaxed to infinity, ‘finite rolls' are never exact solutions of the linearized equations, even though in most cases they are good approximations. We also find that bringing the sidewalls closer together inhibits convection and, generally, produces thinner cells at the onset of convection. {\textcopyright} 1970, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {The influence of sidewalls on the onset of convection in a differentially and internally heated fluid layer is investigated. A two-dimensional approximation to the three-dimensional problem is compared to solutions using a general three-dimensional representation of the toroidal and poloidal vector fields in the case of free and rigid upper and lower boundaries with rigid sidewalls. For all aspect ratios, 0.001≤A≤100, it is found that the critical Rayleigh numbers in the two-dimensional approximation do not differ substantially from the general three-dimensional results. Additionally, in the two-dimensional approximation, the problem is investigated with both internal heating and an imposed temperature difference between the upper and lower boundaries. In this case all boundaries are rigid and the critical Rayleigh numbers, RE, are obtained for aspect ratios between 0.001 and 100 and internal Rayleigh numbers in the range 0≤RI{\textless}106. Where comparison of the results with experimental and previous theoretical results is possible, good agreement is found. {\textcopyright} 1980 Birkh{\"{a}}user-Verlag.},

abstract = {We have studied turbulent convection in a vertical thin (Hele-Shaw) cell at very high Rayleigh numbers (up to 7 X 104 times the value for convective onset) through experiment, simulation, and analysis. Experimentally, convection is driven by an imposed concentration gradient in an isothermal cell. Model equations treat the fields in two dimensions, with the reduced dimension exerting its influence through a linear wall friction. Linear stability analysis of these equations demonstrates that as the thickness of the cell tends to zero, the critical Rayleigh number and wave number for convective onset do not depend on the velocity conditions at the top and bottom boundaries (i.e., no-slip or stress-free). At finite cell thickness 8, however, solutions with different boundary conditions behave differently. We simulate the model equations numerically for both types of boundary conditions. Time sequences of the full concentration fields from experiment and simulation display a large number of solutal plumes that are born in thin concentration boundary layers, merge to form vertical channels, and sometimes split at their tips via a Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Power spectra of the concentration field reveal scaling regions with slopes that depend on the Rayleigh number. We examine the scaling of nondimensional heat flux (the Nusselt number, Mi) and rms vertical velocity (the P{\'{e}}clet number, Pe) with the Rayleigh number (Ra) for the simulations. Both no-slip and stress-free solutions exhibit the scaling NuRa{\~{}}Pe2 that we develop from simple arguments involving dynamics in the interior, away from cell boundaries. In addition, for stress-free solutions a second relation, Nu{\~{}}$\backslash$]nPe, is dictated by stagnation-point flows occurring at the horizontal boundaries; n is the number of plumes per unit length. No-slip solutions exhibit no such organization of the boundary flow and the results appear to agree with Priestley's prediction of Nn{\~{}}Ra. {\textcopyright}1997 American Institute of Physics.},

The hydrodynamic state in such configurations is described by three dimensionless numbers, the Rayleigh number Ra, the aspect ratio (height h/diameter d) and the Prandtl number Pr. Two different types of melts have been investigated, H2O (Pr = 6.7), and Ga and GaSb melts (Pr ≈ 2 × 10-2) for various aspect ratios (0.5 ≤ h/d ≤ 5) and Rayleigh numbers up to 108. Both experimental results and numerical analysis for the onset of convection (critical Rayleigh number Rac1) and the state of convective flow are presented. The values of Rac1 for 0.5 ≤ h/d ≤ 5 and the symmetries of the basic flow (axial symmetry for h/d = 0.5 and non-axial symmetry for 1 ≤ h/d ≤ 5) are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of Charlson and Sani [1]. Te-doped GaSb crystals have been grown by using the vertical Bridgman technique with top seeding. Temperatures have been measured in the GaSb melt during growth and compared with the results of our flow investigations in Ga melts. It shows clearly, that the occurrence of doping striations in the GaSb crystals can be very well correlated to the unsteady flow regimes. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract = {We introduce the “exponential linear unit” (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10{\%} classification error for a single crop, single model network.},

abstract = {We explore heat transport properties of turbulent Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection in horizontally extended systems by using deep-learning algorithms that greatly reduce the number of degrees of freedom. Particular attention is paid to the slowly evolving turbulent superstructures—so called because they are larger in extent than the height of the convection layer—which appear as temporal patterns of ridges of hot upwelling and cold downwelling fluid, including defects where the ridges merge or end. The machine-learning algorithm trains a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with U-shaped architecture, consisting of a contraction and a subsequent expansion branch, to reduce the complex 3D turbulent superstructure to a temporal planar network in the midplane of the layer. This results in a data compression by more than five orders of magnitude at the highest Rayleigh number, and its application yields a discrete transport network with dynamically varying defect points, including points of locally enhanced heat flux or “hot spots.” One conclusion is that the fraction of heat transport by the superstructure decreases as the Rayleigh number increases (although they might remain individually strong), correspondingly implying the increased importance of small-scale background turbulence.},

abstract = {The heat transport and corresponding changes in the large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection are studied by means of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations as a function of the aspect ratio $\gamma$ of a closed cylindrical cell and the Rayleigh number Ra. The Prandtl number is Pr = 0.7 throughout the study. The aspect ratio is varied between 0.5 and 12 for a Rayleigh number range between 107 and 109. The Nusselt number Nu is the dimensionless measure of the global turbulent heat transfer. For small and moderate aspect ratios, the global heat transfer law Nu = A Ra$\beta$ shows a power law dependence of both fit coefficients A and on the aspect ratio. A minimum of Nu($\gamma$) is found at $\gamma$ ≈ 2.5 and $\gamma$ 2.≈25 for Ra = 107 and Ra = 108, respectively. This is the point where the LSC undergoes a transition from a single-roll to a double-roll pattern. With increasing aspect ratio, we detect complex multi-roll LSC configurations in the convection cell. For larger aspect ratios $\gamma$≳ 8, our data indicate that the heat transfer becomes independent of the aspect ratio of the cylindrical cell. The aspect ratio dependence of the turbulent heat transfer for small and moderate $\gamma$ is in line with a varying amount of energy contained in the LSC, as quantified by the Karhunen-Lo{\`{e}}ve or proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis of the turbulent convection field. The POD analysis is conducted here by the snapshot method for at least 100 independent realizations of the turbulent fields. The primary POD mode, which replicates the time-averaged LSC patterns, transports about 50{\%} of the global heat for $\gamma$≥1. The snapshot analysis enables a systematic disentanglement of the contributions of POD modes to the global turbulent heat transfer. Although the smallest scale-the Kolmogorov scale $\eta$K-and the largest scale-the cell height H-are widely separated in a turbulent flow field, the LSC patterns in fully turbulent fields exhibit strikingly similar texture to those in the weakly nonlinear regime right above the onset of convection. Pentagonal or hexagonal circulation cells are observed preferentially if the aspect ratio is sufficiently large ($\gamma$≳8). {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

The simulation is performed in a 6.3 aspect-ratio cylindrical cell with a Rayleigh number of 9.6 × 107 and Prandtl number equal to 6.7. Single-point and double-point statistics compare well against experimental results under nearly identical conditions. Large-scale thermal motions with coherence times exceeding 20 eddy-turnovers (∼600 free-fall time units) are seen in the instantaneous fields. Temporally filtering them by integrating over approximately one eddy-turnover time scale reveals a clear pattern consisting of seven discrete thermal structures: three warm, rising sectors, three cool, falling sectors and a single plume of warm, rising fluid that wanders around the center of the cylindrical cell. Smoothing over still longer times (10 and 20 eddy turn-over time scales) yields a clear hub-and-spoke pattern of warm and cool sectors in a dominantly 120° periodic pattern separated by concentrations of radial vortex lines (the spokes) plus a nearly circular plume at the center of the test section (the hub). The similarity of the patterns in the instantaneous fields and the long-time smoothed fields demonstrates long persistence of these structures, a defining characteristic of coherent structures in turbulence. The warm and cool sectors are intimately linked with conical roll-cells rotating about the spokes, and these circulations are likely the analogs of the ‘wind of turbulence' found in low-aspect-ratio RBC experiments.},

In this paper, we demonstrate a crucial phenomenon: Deep learning typically yields unstable methods for image reconstruction. The instabilities usually occur in several forms: 1) Certain tiny, almost undetectable perturbations, both in the image and sampling domain, may result in severe artefacts in the reconstruction; 2) a small structural change, for example, a tumor, may not be captured in the reconstructed image; and 3) (a counterintuitive type of instability) more samples may yield poorer performance. Our stability test with algorithms and easy-to-use software detects the instability phenomena. The test is aimed at researchers, to test their networks for instabilities, and for government agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to secure safe use of deep learning methods.},

abstract = {Instrumented indentation has been developed and widely utilized as one of the most versatile and practical means of extracting mechanical properties of materials. This method is particularly desirable for those applications where it is difficult to experimentally determine the mechanical properties using stress-strain data obtained from coupon specimens. Such applications include material processing and manufacturing of small and large engineering components and structures involving the following: threedimensional (3D) printing, thin-film and multilayered structures, and integrated manufacturing of materials for coupled mechanical and functional properties. Here, we utilize the latest developments in neural networks, including a multifidelity approach whereby deep-learning algorithms are trained to extract elastoplastic properties of metals and alloys from instrumented indentation results using multiple datasets for desired levels of improved accuracy. We have established algorithms for solving inverse problems by recourse to single, dual, and multiple indentation and demonstrate that these algorithms significantly outperform traditional brute force computations and function-fitting methods. Moreover, we present several multifidelity approaches specifically for solving the inverse indentation problem which 1) significantly reduce the number of high-fidelity datasets required to achieve a given level of accuracy, 2) utilize known physical and scaling laws to improve training efficiency and accuracy, and 3) integrate simulation and experimental data for training disparate datasets to learn and minimize systematic errors. The predictive capabilities and advantages of these multifidelity methods have been assessed by direct comparisons with experimental results for indentation for different commercial alloys, including two wrought aluminum alloys and several 3D printed titanium alloys.},

abstract = {We explore heat transport properties of turbulent Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection in horizontally extended systems by using deep-learning algorithms that greatly reduce the number of degrees of freedom. Particular attention is paid to the slowly evolving turbulent superstructures—so called because they are larger in extent than the height of the convection layer—which appear as temporal patterns of ridges of hot upwelling and cold downwelling fluid, including defects where the ridges merge or end. The machine-learning algorithm trains a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with U-shaped architecture, consisting of a contraction and a subsequent expansion branch, to reduce the complex 3D turbulent superstructure to a temporal planar network in the midplane of the layer. This results in a data compression by more than five orders of magnitude at the highest Rayleigh number, and its application yields a discrete transport network with dynamically varying defect points, including points of locally enhanced heat flux or “hot spots.” One conclusion is that the fraction of heat transport by the superstructure decreases as the Rayleigh number increases (although they might remain individually strong), correspondingly implying the increased importance of small-scale background turbulence.},

abstract = {The calculus of variations is employed to find steady divergence-free velocity fields that maximize transport of a tracer between two parallel walls held at fixed concentration for one of two constraints on flow strength: a fixed value of the kinetic energy (mean square velocity) or a fixed value of the enstrophy (mean square vorticity). The optimizing flows consist of an array of (convection) cells of a particular aspect ratio $\Gamma$. We solve the nonlinear Euler-Lagrange equations analytically for weak flows and numerically - as well as via matched asymptotic analysis in the fixed energy case - for strong flows. We report the results in terms of the Nusselt number Nu, a dimensionless measure of the tracer transport, as a function of the P{\'{e}}clet number Pe, a dimensionless measure of the strength of the flow. For both constraints, the maximum transport NuMAX(Pe) is realized in cells of decreasing aspect ratio $\Gamma$opt(Pe) as Pe increases. For the fixed energy problem, NuMAX {\~{}} Pe and $\Gamma$opt {\~{}} Pe-1/2, while for the fixed enstrophy scenario, NuMAX {\~{}} Pe10/17 and $\Gamma$opt {\~{}} Pe-0.36. We interpret our results in the context of buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection problems that satisfy the flow intensity constraints, enabling us to investigate how the transport scalings compare with upper bounds on Nu expressed as a function of the Rayleigh number Ra. For steady convection in porous media, corresponding to the fixed energy problem, we find NuMAX {\~{}} Ra and $\Gamma$ opt {\~{}} Ra-1/2, while for steady convection in a pure fluid layer between stress-free isothermal walls, corresponding to fixed enstrophy transport, NuMAX {\~{}} Ra5/12 and $\Gamma$opt {\~{}} Ra-1/4. {\textcopyright} 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The current work involves identification of coherent structures in rotating turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection (RBC) in a moderately large aspect-ratio (8:8:1) rectangular enclosure. The enclosure is rotating about a vertical axis passing through its center of gravity. The incompressible Navier-Stokes and energy equations are solved in a rotating frame of reference and the resulting velocity and thermal fields are analyzed to educe coherent structures. The flow structures have been investigated at different nondimensional rotation rates ranging from $\omega$=0 to 104 for a fixed Rayleigh number Ra=107 and Prandtl number Pr=0.01, keeping the Raw/Ta ratio constant at 10-3 in order to stringently maintain Boussinesq approximation as well as to attain experimentally realizable rotational Rayleigh numbers. Coherent structures in the flow domain have been sought using different identification techniques, namely large eddy simulation (LES) decomposition using top-hat filter, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) considering larger energy modes, second invariant (Q) of the velocity gradient tensor, and regions of negative $\lambda$2, the second largest eigenvalue of the tensor SikSkj +$\Omega$ik$\Omega$kj. It has been found that the coherent structures educed using POD or LES decomposition at low to moderate rotation ($\omega$=10 to 103) show the formation of two to three large-scale rolls aligned along both horizontal directions. At higher-rotation rates corresponding to $\omega$=104, there is a breakup of large-scale structures into multiple small-scale rolls having random spatial orientation. The thermal structures educed using both POD and large-scale LES decomposition at zero rotation show randomly rising and descending plumes that at $\Omega$=10 coalesce to form a large cylindrical thermal plume in the core of the cavity. Further increase of rotation leads again to breakup of the cylindrical plume into multiple random plumes. Isosurfaces of Q and $\lambda$2 reveal elongated tubular roll-like structures mainly concentrated near the side-wall regions, though at higher rotation-rate ($\omega$= 104) the density of tubular structures increases significantly. There is a strong similarity of results obtained by large-scale LES decomposition and results obtained using mean plus first mode of POD decomposition. The structures educed using Q and $\lambda$2 are different in shape compared to LES or POD educed structures. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {For two-dimensional Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nard convection, classes of unstable, steady solutions were previously computed using numerical continuation (Waleffe, 2015; Sondak, 2015). The `primary' steady solution bifurcates from the conduction state at {\$}Ra \backslashapprox 1708{\$}, and has a characteristic aspect ratio (length/height) of approximately {\$}2{\$}. The primary solution corresponds to one pair of counterclockwise-clockwise convection rolls with a temperature updraft in between and an adjacent downdraft on the sides. By adjusting the horizontal length of the domain, (Waleffe, 2015; Sondak, 2015) also found steady, maximal heat transport solutions, with characteristic aspect ratio less than {\$}2{\$} and decreasing with increasing {\$}Ra{\$}. Compared to the primary solutions, optimal heat transport solutions have modifications to boundary layer thickness, the horizontal length scale of the plume, and the structure of the downdrafts. The current study establishes a direct link between these (unstable) steady solutions and transition to turbulence for {\$}Pr = 7{\$} and {\$}Pr = 100{\$}. For transitional values of {\$}Ra{\$}, the primary and optimal heat transport solutions both appear prominently in appropriately-sized sub-fields of the time-evolving temperature fields. For {\$}Ra{\$} beyond transitional, our data analysis shows persistence of the primary solution for {\$}Pr = 7{\$}, while the optimal heat transport solutions are more easily detectable for {\$}Pr = 100{\$}. In both cases {\$}Pr = 7{\$} and {\$}Pr = 100{\$}, the relative prevalence of primary and optimal solutions is consistent with the {\$}Nu{\$} vs. {\$}Ra{\$} scalings for the numerical data and the steady solutions.},

The Rayleigh numbers Ra are between 107 and 3×10 10. We apply a criterion that decomposes the cell volume into two disjoint subsets: the plume-dominated part and the turbulent background part. The plume-dominated set extends over the whole cell volume and is not confined to the boundary layers. It forms a complex spatial skeleton on which the heat is transported in the convection cell and its volume fraction decreases with increasing Rayleigh number. The latter finding holds also when the threshold, which separates both subvolumes, is varied. The Rayleigh number dependence of the mean moments and probability density functions of the thermal dissipation are analyzed on the subvolumes and related to other possible divisions of the convection volume, such as into boundary layer and bulk. The largest thermal dissipation events are always found in the plume-dominated subset. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences / Societ́a Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2012.},

Direct numerical simulations are carried out in a cylindrical cell with unit aspect ratio filled with a fluid with Prandtl number equal to 0.7 for Rayleigh numbers between 107 and 109. The probability density function of the temperature or its fluctuations is found to be always non-Gaussian. The asymmetry and strength of deviations from the Gaussian distribution are quantified as a function of the cell height. The deviations of the temperature fluctuations from the local isotropy, as measured by the skewness of the vertical derivative of the temperature fluctuations, decrease in the bulk, but increase in the thermal boundary layer for growing Rayleigh number, respectively. Similarly to the passive scalar mixing, the probability density function of the thermal dissipation rate deviates significantly from a log-normal distribution. The distribution is fitted well by a stretched exponential form. The tails become more extended with increasing Rayleigh number which displays an increasing degree of small-scale intermittency of the thermal dissipation field for both the bulk and the thermal boundary layer. We find that the thermal dissipation rate due to the temperature fluctuations is not only dominant in the bulk of the convection cell, but also yields a significant contribution to the total thermal dissipation in the thermal boundary layer. This is in contrast to the ansatz used in scaling theories and can explain the differences in the scaling of the total thermal dissipation rate with respect to the Rayleigh number. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {     By means of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we investigate the influence of the regular roughness of heated and cooled plates on the mean heat transport in a cylindrical Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection cell of aspect ratio one. The roughness is introduced by a set of isothermal obstacles, which are attached to the plates and have a form of concentric rings of the same width. The considered Prandtl number    {\$}Pr{\$}   equals 1, the Rayleigh number    {\$}Ra{\$}   varies from    {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}6{\}}{\$}   to    {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}{\$}   , the number of rings on each plate is 1, 2, 4, 8 or 10, the height of the rings is varied from 1.5 {\%} to 49 {\%} of the cylinder height and the gap between the rings is varied from 1.5 {\%} to 18.8 {\%} of the cell diameter. Totally, 135 different cases are analysed. Direct numerical simulations show that with small    {\$}Ra{\$}   and wide roughness rings, a small reduction of the mean heat transport (the Nusselt number    {\$}Nu{\$}   ) is possible, but, in most cases, the presence of the heated and cooled obstacles generally leads to an increase of    {\$}Nu{\$}   , compared to the case of classical Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection with smooth plates. When the rings are very tall and the gaps between them are sufficiently wide, the effective mean heat flux can be several times larger than in the smooth case. For a fixed geometry of the obstacles, the scaling exponent in the    {\$}Nu{\$}   versus    {\$}Ra{\$}   scaling first increases with growing    {\$}Ra{\$}   up to approximately 0.5, but then smoothly decreases back towards the exponent in the no-obstacle case. },

Different values of the Grashof number Gr and vibrational Grashof number Grv and all the possible orientations of the vibrations are considered. Numerical results show that depending on the vibration direction, the flow can be amplified or damped, with even the possibility of flow inversion which can occur between critical vibration angles $\alpha$1 and $\alpha$2. A general theoretical expression is derived relating these critical angles and the ratio of vibrational to buoyant convection parameters, Grv/Gr.

Two possible configurations, namely, (1) HCCH and (2) HCHC, are studied in which a unit step function describes the conduction wall temperature as a combination of hot (H) and cold (C) temperatures. The first two letters (of HCCH or HCHC) represent the applied thermal conditions on the bottom wall and the last two letters represent those on the top wall. In the mentioned configurations, the average temperature difference between the bottom and top walls is zero, yet the complex convection state is observed. The diagonally aligned large-scale elliptic roll observed in the RB convection for the Rayleigh number Ra = 108 is found to be replaced by a circular roll in HCCH and a square roll in HCHC. The mean and fluctuating temperature fields in cases of HCCH and HCHC are significantly high as compared to the RB case. We found that heat transport is higher for HCCH and HCHC as compared to the RB convection in a range of 105 ≤ Ra {\textless} 108. The increase in heat transport is due to (1) an increase in the background potential energy in the case of HCCH and (2) an increase in the available potential energy in the case of HCHC, which is confirmed by using the global energy budget.},

abstract = {Characterization of coherent structures in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection using statistical measures is presented in the present work. Numerical simulations are carried out in a two-dimensional (2D) rectangular cell with aspect ratio 2 using air as the working fluid across four decades of Rayleigh number. The absence of one lateral dimension leads to entrapment of plumes which are consequently emitted in the form of thermal jets. Axial nonuniformity in thermal boundary layers is eliminated at high Rayleigh numbers. The so-called slope and 99{\%} methods produce identical boundary layer thicknesses whose power law variation confirms theoretical inverse-Nu scaling. Turbulent kinetic energy budget unveils a transport-dissipation balance near the walls with buoyancy production nearly sustaining turbulent fluctuations in the bulk region. A higher threshold for the correlation between the vertical velocity and temperature results in faster convergence of plume and background share of dissipation, while decay in the volume fraction of the plume region continues. Exponential distribution of temperature fluctuations suggests the presence of hard turbulence at very large Rayleigh numbers with wider tails recording extreme fluctuating events. Changes in plume emission and its subsequent motion not only influence boundary layer instabilities but also cause departure from the -5/3 law in the frequency spectra.},

High resolution two-dimensional direct numerical simulations were carried out for the Rayleigh number (Ra) of 106 ≤ Ra ≤ 107 and the Prandtl number (Pr) of 0.025. Our results show that the global heat transport and momentum scaling in terms of Nusselt number (Nu) and Reynolds number (Re) are Nu = 0.21Ra0.25 and Re = 6.11Ra0.50, respectively, indicating that scaling exponents are smaller than those for moderate-Prandtl number fluids (such as water or air) in the same convection cell. In the central region of the cell, probability density functions (PDFs) of temperature profiles show stretched exponential peak and the Gaussian tail; in the sidewall region, PDFs of temperature profiles show a multimodal distribution at relatively lower Ra, while they approach the Gaussian profile at relatively higher Ra. We split the energy dissipation rate into contributions from bulk and boundary layers and found the locally averaged thermal energy dissipation rate from the boundary layer region is an order of magnitude larger than that from the bulk region. Even if the much smaller volume occupied by the boundary layer region is considered, the globally averaged thermal energy dissipation rate from the boundary layer region is still larger than that from the bulk region. We further numerically determined the scaling exponents of globally averaged thermal energy dissipation rates as functions of Ra and Re.},

The evolution of this field is studied systematically in a wide range of frequencies and amplitudes. The flow structures reported in previous numerical studies are confirmed.

abstract = {Turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection is characterized by the presence of intense coherent structures called plumes. With additional system rotation along an axis parallel to gravity, individual plumes can merge together to form larger thermal structures. In this paper, we propose an efficient way to quantify plume merging using three accessible statistics: plume vorticity, plume number and plume area. Using this approach, we show that plume merging is more intense for moderate values of the Rossby number, around Ro≈1. Merging is spatially localized near boundary layers, determining what we call the "merging region". Inside this region, vertical heat transport by individual plumes is enhanced. Outside the merging region, on the other hand, rotating plumes transport less heat than in the non-rotating case. Since the total heat transport is enhanced by rotation in the turbulent regime explored here, this implies that outside the merging region the vortical structures of background turbulence transport heat more effectively than in the non-rotating case.},

abstract = {Ultrasound imaging remains out of reach for most pregnant women in developing countries because it requires a trained sonographer to acquire and interpret the images. We address this problem by presenting a system that can automatically estimate the fetal head circumference (HC) from data obtained with use of the obstetric sweep protocol (OSP). The OSP consists of multiple pre-defined sweeps with the ultrasound transducer over the abdomen of the pregnant woman. The OSP can be taught within a day to any health care worker without prior knowledge of ultrasound. An experienced sonographer acquired both the standard plane—to obtain the reference HC—and the OSP from 183 pregnant women in St. Luke's Hospital, Wolisso, Ethiopia. The OSP data, which will most likely not contain the standard plane, was used to automatically estimate HC using two fully convolutional neural networks. First, a VGG-Net-inspired network was trained to automatically detect the frames that contained the fetal head. Second, a U-net-inspired network was trained to automatically measure the HC for all frames in which the first network detected a fetal head. The HC was estimated from these frame measurements, and the curve of Hadlock was used to determine gestational age (GA). The results indicated that most automatically estimated GAs fell within the P2.5–P97.5 interval of the Hadlock curve compared with the GAs obtained from the reference HC, so it is possible to automatically estimate GA from OSP data. Our method therefore has potential application for providing maternal care in resource-constrained countries.},

abstract = {We numerically explore the dynamics of an incompressible fluid heated from below, bounded by free-slip horizontal plates and periodic lateral boundary conditions, subject to rapid rotation about a distant axis that is tilted with respect to the gravity vector. The angle ϕ between the rotation axis and the horizontal plane measures the tilting of the rotation axis; it can be taken as a proxy for latitude if we think of a local Cartesian representation of the convective dynamics in a rotating fluid shell. The results of the simulations indicate the existence of three different convective regimes, depending on the value of ϕ: (1) sheared, intermittent large-scale winds in the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by the gravity and rotation vectors, when rotation is "horizontal" (ϕ=0{\^{}}{\{}∘{\}}); (2) a large-scale cyclonic vortex tilted along the rotation axis, when the angle between the rotation axis and the gravity vector is relatively small (ϕ between about 45{\^{}}{\{}∘{\}} and 90{\^{}}{\{}∘{\}}); and (3) a new intermediate regime characterized by vertically sheared large-scale winds perpendicular to both gravity and rotation. In this regime, the winds are organized in bands that are tilted along the rotation axis, with unit horizontal wave number in the plane defined by gravity and rotation at values of ϕ less than about 60{\^{}}{\{}∘{\}}. This intermediate solution, studied for the first time in this work, is characterized by weaker vertical heat transport than the cases with large-scale vortices. For intermediate values of ϕ (between about 45{\^{}}{\{}∘{\}} and 60{\^{}}{\{}∘{\}}), the banded, sheared solution coexists with the large-scale vortex solution, with different initial conditions leading to one or the other dynamical behavior. A discussion of the possible implications of these results for the dynamics of rapidly rotating planetary atmospheres is provided.},

Even though the density ratio becomes thousands times that of the critical value {\$}\backslashLambda{\_}c{\$}, there is still convection with strongly enhanced heat transfer properties compared to the pure conduction case. We reveal the corresponding flow structures and find an unstably-stratified region sandwiched between two stably-stratified layers. Our results demonstrate the importance of the initial condition for DDC in the diffusive regime, especially in the situation of a large density ratio, which occurs in high-latitude ocean regions.},

Here, we approach this question conceptually by investigating a class of pattern forming systems in the presence of random advection by a Kraichnan-Kazantsev velocity field. Combining tools from pattern formation with statistical theory and simulations, we show that random advection shifts the onset and the wave number of emergent patterns. As a simple model for pattern formation in convection, the effects are demonstrated with a generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation including random advection.

abstract = {Recent studies of rotating Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection at high rotation rates and strong thermal forcing have shown a significant discrepancy in total heat transport between experiments on a confined cylindrical domain on the one hand and simulations on a laterally unconfined periodic domain on the other. This paper addresses this discrepancy using direct numerical simulations on a cylindrical domain. An analysis of the flow field reveals a region of enhanced convection near the wall, the sidewall circulation. The sidewall circulation rotates slowly within the cylinder in anticyclonic direction. It has a convoluted structure, illustrated by mean flow fields in horizontal cross sections of the flow where instantaneous snapshots are compensated for the orientation of the sidewall circulation before averaging. Through separate analysis of the sidewall region and the inner bulk flow, we find that for higher values of the thermal forcing the heat transport in the inner part of the cylindrical domain, outside the sidewall circulation region, coincides with the heat transport on the unconfined periodic domain. Thus the sidewall circulation accounts for the differences in heat transfer between the two considered domains, while in the bulk the turbulent heat flux is the same as that of a laterally unbounded periodic domain. Therefore, experiments, with their inherent confinement, can still provide turbulence akin to the unbounded domains of simulations and at more extreme values of the governing parameters for thermal forcing and rotation. We also provide experimental evidence for the existence of the sidewall circulation that is in close agreement with the simulation results.},

Perfect air is chosen as the operating fluid and the Prandtl number is fixed to 0.71 for the reference state. In the present system, we consider large temperature differences ranging from 60 K to 240 K, and relatively strong NOB effects are induced at moderate Rayleigh numbers in the range. The large temperature difference also induces the turbulence system with large density variation. Due to top-down symmetry breaking under NOB conditions, an increase of the centre temperature is found compared to the arithmetic mean temperature of the top and bottom plates, and the shift of is strongly dependent on Rayleigh number and temperature differential. The NOB effects on the Nusselt number are quite small . The power-law scalings of versus are robust against NOB effects, even for the extremely large temperature difference 240 K, which has never been reached in previous experiments and simulations. The Reynolds numbers , as well as the scalings of versus , are also insensitive to NOB effects. It is noteworthy that the influence of NOB effects on and in 3-D RB flow are weaker than its 2-D counterpart. Furthermore, the extended laminar boundary layer (BL) equations are developed based on the low-Mach-number Navier-Stokes equations, which qualitatively predicts the NOB effects on velocity profiles. Direct numerical simulation results indicate that the top and bottom thermal BLs can compensate each other much better than the velocity BLs under NOB conditions, which contribute to the robustness of.},

The scaled radial profiles of the azimuthal velocity {\$}u{\_}{\{}\backslashphi{\}}(r){\$} and vertical vorticity {\$}{\{}\backslashomega{\}}(r){\$} of the vortices are analyzed and compared with the predictions of the asymptotic theory. The results reveal that the asymptotic theory predicts accurately {\$}u{\_}{\{}\backslashphi{\}}(r){\$} and {\$}{\{}\backslashomega{\}}(r){\$} in the geostrophic convection regime, but extension of the theory in the weak rotation regime is needed to interpret the rotation-dependence of the experimental data. Our measurements of the mean velocity, vorticity of the vortices, and the strength of the vortex shield structure all indicate a flow transition from weekly rotating convection to geostrophic convection. Results of the parameter values for the transition are in agreement with the scaling relationship obtained from previous heat-transfer measurements.},

abstract = {We apply the weak formalism on the Boussinesq equations, to characterize scaling properties of the mean and the standard deviation of the potential, kinetic and viscous energy flux in very high resolution numerical simulations. The local Bolgiano-Oboukhov length {\$}L{\_}{\{}BO{\}}{\$} is investigated and it is found that its value may change of an order of magnitude through the domain, in agreement with previous results. We investigate the scale-by-scale averaged terms of the weak equations, which are a generalization of the Karman-Howarth-Monin and Yaglom equations. We have not found the classical Bolgiano-Oboukhov picture, but evidence of a mixture of Bolgiano-Oboukhov and Kolmogorov scalings. In particular, all the terms are compatible with a Bolgiano-Oboukhov local H$\backslash$"older exponent for the temperature and a Kolmogorov 41 for the velocity. This behavior may be related to anisotropy and to the strong heterogeneity of the convective flow, reflected in the wide distribution of Bolgiano-Oboukhov local scales. The scale-by-scale analysis allows us also to compare the theoretical Bolgiano-Oboukhov length {\$}L{\_}{\{}BO{\}}{\$} computed from its definition with that empirically extracted through scalings obtained from weak analysis. The key result of the work is to show that the analysis of local weak formulation of the problem is powerful to characterize the fluctuation properties.},

abstract = {In Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection experiments, the thermal coupling between the sidewall and fluid is unavoidable. As a result, the thermal properties of the sidewall can influence the flow structure that develops. To get a better understanding of the influence of the sidewall, we performed a one-to-one comparison between experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) in aspect ratio (diameter over height) {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6E4{\}}=1.00{\$} samples. We focus on the global heat transport, i.e. the Nusselt number {\$}Nu{\$} , and the local vertical temperature gradients near the horizontal mid-plane on the cylinder axis and close to the sidewall. The data cover the range {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}5{\}}\backslashlesssim Ra\backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$} where {\$}Ra{\$} is the Rayleigh number. The {\$}Nu{\$} number obtained from experimental measurements and DNS, in which we use an adiabatic sidewall, agree well. The experiments are performed with several gases, which have widely varying thermal conductivities, but all have a Prandtl number {\$}Pr\backslashapprox 0.7{\$} . For {\$}Ra\backslashgtrsim 10{\^{}}{\{}7{\}}{\$} , both experiments and DNS reveal a stabilizing (positive) temperature gradient at the cylinder axis. This phenomenon was known for high {\$}Pr{\$} , but had not been observed for small {\$}Pr\backslashapprox 0.7{\$} before. The experiments reveal that the temperature gradient decreases with decreasing {\$}Ra{\$} and eventually becomes destabilizing (negative). The decrease appears at a higher {\$}Ra{\$} when the sidewall admittance, which measures how easily the heat transfers from the fluid to the wall, is smaller. However, the simulations with an adiabatic sidewall do not reproduce the destabilizing temperature gradient at the cylinder axis in the low {\$}Ra{\$} number regime. Instead, these simulations show that the temperature gradient increases with decreasing {\$}Ra{\$} . We find that the simulations can reproduce the experimental findings on the temperature gradient at the cylinder axis qualitatively when we consider the physical properties of the sidewall and the thermal shields. However, the temperature gradients obtained from experiments and simulations do not agree quantitatively. The reason is that it is incredibly complicated to reproduce all experimental details accurately due to which it is impossible to reproduce all experimental measurement details. The simulations show, in agreement with the models of Ahlers ( Phys. Rev. E, vol. 63 (1), 2000, 015303) and Roche et al. ( Eur. Phys. J. B, vol. 24 (3), 2001, pp. 405–408), that the sidewall can act as an extra heat conductor, which absorbs heat from the fluid near the bottom plate and releases it into the fluid near the top plate. The importance of this effect decreases with increasing {\$}Ra{\$} . A crucial finding of the simulations is that the thermal coupling between the sidewall and fluid can strongly influence the flow structure, which can result in significant changes in heat transport. Since this effect goes beyond a simple short circuit of the heat transfer through the sidewall, it is impossible to correct experimental measurements for this effect. Therefore, careful design of experimental set-ups is required to minimize the thermal interaction between the fluid and sidewall.},

@article{MacDonald2019,
abstract = {Heat and momentum transfer in wall-bounded turbulent flow, coupled with the effects of wall-roughness, is one of the outstanding questions in turbulence research. In the standard Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'enard problem for natural thermal convection, it is notoriously difficult to reach the so-called ultimate regime in which the near-wall boundary layers are turbulent. Following the analyses proposed by Kraichnan [Phys. Fluids vol 5., pp. 1374-1389 (1962)] and Grossmann {\&} Lohse [Phys. Fluids vol. 23, pp. 045108 (2011)], we instead utilize recent direct numerical simulations of forced convection over a rough wall in a minimal channel [MacDonald, Hutchins {\&} Chung, J. Fluid Mech. vol. 861, pp. 138--162 (2019)] to directly study these turbulent boundary layers. We focus on the heat transport (in dimensionless form, the Nusselt number {\$}Nu{\$}) or equivalently the heat transfer coefficient (the Stanton number {\$}C{\_}h{\$}). Extending the analyses of Kraichnan and Grossmann {\&} Lohse, we assume logarithmic temperature profiles with a roughness-induced shift to predict an effective scaling of {\$}Nu \backslashsim Ra{\^{}}{\{}0.42{\}}{\$}, where {\$}Ra{\$} is the dimensionless temperature difference, corresponding to {\$}C{\_}h \backslashsim Re{\^{}}{\{}-0.16{\}}{\$}, where {\$}Re{\$} is the centerline Reynolds number. This is pronouncedly different from the skin-friction coefficient {\$}C{\_}f{\$}, which in the fully rough turbulent regime is independent of {\$}Re{\$}, due to the dominant pressure drag. In rough-wall turbulence the absence of the analog to pressure drag in the temperature advection equation is the origin for the very different scaling properties of the heat transfer as compared to the momentum transfer. This analysis suggests that, unlike momentum transfer, the asymptotic ultimate regime, where {\$}Nu\backslashsim Ra{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}{\$}, will never be reached for heat transfer at finite {\$}Ra{\$}.},

abstract = {The turbulent convection of low-Prandtl-number fluids (Pr=0.0083) in a long cylindrical cell, heated at one end face and cooled at the other, inclined to the vertical at angle $\beta$, 0≤$\beta$≤$\pi$/2 with step $\pi$/20, is studied numerically by solving the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations with the large-eddy-simulation approach for small-scale turbulence. The cylinder length is L=5D, where D is the diameter. The Rayleigh number, determined by the cylinder diameter, is of the order of 5×106. We show that the structure of the flow strongly depends on the inclination angle. A stable large-scale circulation (LSC) slightly disturbed by small-scale turbulence exists in the horizontal cylinder. The deviation from a horizontal position provides strong amplification of both LSC and small-scale turbulence. The energy of turbulent pulsations increases monotonically with decreasing inclination angle $\beta$, matching the energy of the LSC at $\beta$≈$\pi$/5. The intensity of the LSC has a wide, almost flat, maximum for an inclined cylinder and slumps approaching the vertical position, in which the LSC vanishes. The dependence of the Nusselt number on the inclination angle has a maximum at $\beta$≈7$\pi$/20 and generally follows the dependence of the intensity of LSC on the inclination. This indicates that the total heat transport is highly determined by LSC. We examine the applicability of idealized thermal boundary conditions (BCs) for modeling a real experiment with liquid sodium flows. Therefore, the simulations are done with two types of temperature BCs: fixed face temperature and fixed heat flux. The intensity of the LSC is slightly higher in the latter case and leads to a corresponding increase of the Nusselt number and enhancement of temperature pulsations.},

@article{Guervilly2017,
abstract = {One of the most prominent dynamical features of turbulent, rapidly rotating convection is the formation of large-scale coherent structures, driven by Reynolds stresses resulting from the small-scale convective flows. In spherical geometry, such structures consist of intense zonal flows that are invariant along the rotation axis. In planar geometry, long-lived, depth-invariant structures also form at large scales, but, in the absence of horizontal anisotropy, they consist of vortices that grow to the domain size. In this work, through the introduction of horizontal anisotropy into a numerical model of planar rotating convection by the adoption of unequal horizontal box sizes (i.e., Lx≤Ly, where the xy plane is horizontal), we investigate whether unidirectional flows and large-scale vortices can coexist. We find that only a small degree of anisotropy is required to bring about a transition from dynamics dominated by persistent large-scale vortices to dynamics dominated by persistent unidirectional flows parallel to the shortest horizontal direction. When the anisotropy is sufficiently large, the unidirectional flow consists of multiple jets, generated on a time scale smaller than a global viscous time scale, thus signifying that the upscale energy transfer does not spontaneously feed the largest available mode in the system. That said, the multiple jets merge on much longer time scales. Large-scale vortices of size comparable with Lx systematically form in the flanks of the jets and can be persistent or intermittent. This indicates that large-scale vortices, either coexisting with jets or not, are a robust dynamical feature of planar rotating convection.},

On the other hand, the observed quantum yield for light of 1.0-micron wavelength is 1 x10 '. (Quantum yield is here defined as the. number of electrons flowing in the external circuit per photon incident on the tin.) Effects which might be due to stray light of higher energies may be ruled out by the observation that placing the gallium arsenide filter in the light path does not change the shape of the spectral response curve. A Fowler plot" has been made of the data for the range 0.88 to 1.30 eV. There is a good fit between the experimental data and the theoretical function for a barrier height of 0.75 eV in agree-ment with the other estimates of the barrier height mentioned above. The author is indebted to A. M. Goodman for carrying out the measurements of barrier ca-pacitance and to J. Blanc for several helpful discussions. Optical second harmonic generation has been observed as a function of an applied dc electric field in the crystal calcite, which possesses a center of inversion. Of particular significance, a small amount of doubling was observed to oc-cur with no dc electric field applied. The elec-tric-field-induced doubling and the doubling in crystals lacking a center of inversion can be un-derstood in terms of a three-photon process: the electric-dipole absorption of two similar photons followed by the electric-dipole emission of a third photon of twice the energy. ' We be-lieve the doubling, which we observe in calcite with no dc electric field applied, to be associated with the next order 3-photon process which in-volves an electric-quadrupole transition. We have also observed optical third harmonic gener-ation in calcite. The focused output beam of a one-joule pulsed ruby laser was used for all of the experiments reported here. Electrodes were imbedded in the calcite crystals for the electric-field-induced experiments. Results for a carefully prepared sample are shown in Fig. 1. Note that the second harmonic signal persists at zero applied field. The upper plot is included to show that the second harmonic generation is composed of two parts: the field-induced part with a light amplitude pro-portional to the applied field and a second part which adds to the first in quadrature. The data in Fig. 1 were taken with the laser bream incident at -27' to the optic axis and the laser polarized so that it passed through the crystal as an ordinary ray. At this angle the index of the ordinary ray at the laser wavelength is equal to that of the extraordinary ray at the second harmonic wavelength. '{\~{}}' The sharp angu-lar dependence of the output intensity reported previously for this type of index matching was observed. Somewhat weaker, second harmonic generation was also observed to occur at -37 to the optic axis with the laser polarized so that one has both ordinary and extraordinary laser light in the crystal. At this angle the indices are matched for combining an ordinary red ray with an extraordinary red ray to produce a sec-ond harmonic blue extraordinary ray. Second harmonic generation at the surfaces coherent with the bulk electric-field-induced second harmonic generation was observed. These 404},

abstract = {We report experimental results for the influence of a tilt angle beta relative to gravity on turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection of cylindrical samples. The measurements were made at Rayleigh numbers R up to 10{\^{}}11 with two samples of height L equal to the diameter D (aspect ratio Gamma = D/L = 1). The fluid was water with a Prandtl number sigma = 4.38. In contrast to the experiences reported by Chilla et. al. (2004) for a similar sample but with Gamma = 0.5 (D = 0.5 and L = 1.0 m), we found no long relaxation times. For R = 9.4 times 10{\^{}}10 we measured the Nusselt number N as a function of tilt angle beta and obtained a small beta dependence about a factor of 50 smaller than the result found by Chilla et. al. (2004) for their Gamma = 0.5 sample. We measured side-wall temperatures at eight equally spaced azimuthal locations on the horizontal mid-plane of the sample and used their cross-correlation functions to find the turn-over time of the large-scale circulation (LSC). The resulting Reynolds numbers R{\_}e{\^{}}cc were found to increase with beta. An important conclusion is that the increase of R{\_}e{\^{}}cc with beta of the LSC does not significantly influence the heat transport. Over the range 10{\^{}}9 {\textless} R {\textless} 10{\^{}}11 the enhancement of R{\_}e{\^{}}cc at constant beta due to the tilt could be described by a power law of R with an exponent of -1/6, consistent with a simple model that balances the additional buoyancy due to the tilt angle by the shear stress across the boundary layers. Even a small tilt angle dramatically suppressed the azimuthal meandering and the sudden reorientations characteristic of the LSC in a sample with beta = 0. The azimuthal mean of the temperature at the horizontal mid-plane within our resolution was independent of beta.},

The measurements are performed in a rectangular cell (aspect ratio $\Gamma$x=1 and $\Gamma$y=0.25) over a wide range of tilt angles (0⩽$\beta$⩽$\pi$/2 rad) at constant Prandtl (Pr≃10) and Rayleigh (Ra≃6.80×1010) numbers. It is found that the plume width, $\lambda$, is distributed log-normally in space and the time-averaged most probable plume width, 〈$\lambda$p〉, has similar scale with the thermal boundary layer thickness, $\lambda$T. 〈$\lambda$p〉 and $\lambda$T slowly increase as tilt angle, $\beta$, increases from 0 to 1 rad and they broaden rapidly as $\beta${\textgreater}1 rad. The average plume area density, 〈$\Phi$〉, deduced from the image intensity, is proposed to represent the heat flux of thermal plumes. Its $\beta$ dependence is consistent with that of the Nusselt number, Nu, over the tilt angle range. $\lambda$p and $\Phi$ exhibit oscillation of convective flow. The oscillation intensity and period strongly depend on $\beta$, but are less affected by Ra and Pr. The plume velocity exhibits a different pattern from that of the two-dimensional convective flow measured at Pr≃6.3 and Ra≃4.42×109. The magnitude of plume velocity peak is weakly affected by the cell tilting. The position of the plume velocity peak increases linearly with increasing $\beta$.},

abstract = {Building on a method of analysis for the Navier-Stokes equations introduced by Hopf [Math. Ann. 117, 764 (1941)], a variational principle for upper bounds on the largest possible time averaged convective heat flux is derived from the Boussinesq equations of motion. When supplied with appropriate test background fields satisfying a spectral constraint, reminiscent of an energy stability condition, the variational formulation produces rigorous upper bounds on the Nusselt number (Nu) as a function of the Rayleigh number (Ra). For the case of vertical heat convection between parallel plates in the absence of sidewalls, a simplified (but rigorous) formulation of the optimization problem yields the large Rayleigh number bound Nu≤0.167 Ra1/2. Non-linear Euler-Lagrange equations for the optimal background fields are also derived, which allow us to make contact with the upper bound theory of Howard [J. Fluid Mech. 17, 405 (1963)] for statistically stationary flows. The structure of solutions of the Euler-Lagrange equations are elucidated from the geometry of the variational constraints, which sheds light on Busse's [J. Fluid Mech. 37, 457 (1969)] asymptotic analysis of general solutions to Howard's Euler-Lagrange equations. The results of our analysis are discussed in the context of theory, recent experiments, and direct numerical simulations.},

abstract = { We investigate the influence of the thermal properties of the boundaries in turbulent Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection on analytical upper bounds on convective heat transport. We model imperfectly conducting bounding plates in two ways: using idealized mixed thermal boundary conditions (BCs) of constant Biot number $\eta$, continuously interpolating between the previously studied fixed temperature ($\eta$ = 0) and fixed flux ($\eta$ = ∞) cases; and by explicitly coupling the evolution equations in the fluid in the Boussinesq approximation through temperature and flux continuity to identical upper and lower conducting plates. In both cases, we systematically formulate a bounding principle and obtain explicit upper bounds on the Nusselt number Nu in terms of the usual Rayleigh number Ra measuring the average temperature drop across the fluid layer, using the ‘background method' developed by Doering and Constantin. In the presence of plates, we find that the bounds depend on $\sigma$ = d /$\lambda$, where d is the ratio of plate to fluid thickness and $\lambda$ is the conductivity ratio, and that the bounding problem may be mapped onto that for Biot number $\eta$ = $\sigma$. In particular, for each $\sigma$ {\textgreater} 0, for sufficiently large Ra (depending on $\sigma$) we show that Nu ≤ c ($\sigma$) R 1/3 ≤ C Ra 1/2 , where C is a $\sigma$-independent constant, and where the control parameter R is a Rayleigh number defined in terms of the full temperature drop across the entire plate–fluid–plate system. In the Ra → ∞ limit, the usual fixed temperature assumption is a singular limit of the general bounding problem, while fixed flux conditions appear to be most relevant to the asymptotic Nu – Ra scaling even for highly conducting plates. },

We have used the formalism of mode-to-mode energy transfer rate in our calculation. The evolution equations derived using this scheme is the same as those derived using the hydrodynamical equations for thermal convection in Boussinesq fluids. Numerical and analytical studies of this model show that convective rolls appear as the Rayleigh number R is raised above its critical value R c . Further increase of Rayleigh number generates rolls in the perpendicular directions as well, and we obtain a dynamic asymmetric square pattern. This pattern is due to Hopf bifurcation. There are two sets of limit cycles corresponding to the two competing asymmetric square patterns. When the Rayleigh number is increased further, the limit cycles become unstable simultaneously, and chaotic motion sets in. The onset of chaos is via intermittent route. The trajectories wander for quite a long time almost periodically before jumping irregularly to one of the two ghost limit cycles. {\textcopyright} Indian Academy of Sciences.},

The considered tilt angle $\beta$ ranges from 0° to 90°. The Prandtl number Pr dependence is first studied in the range of 0.01 ≤ Pr ≤ 100 for a fixed Rayleigh number Ra = 107. The Ra dependence is also investigated in the range of 106 ≤ Ra ≤ 109 for a fixed Pr = 0.71. Different flow states are identified over the $\beta$ - Pr parameter space. It is found that the flow tends to organize in stable vertically-stacked double-roll state (DRS) for small Pr and small $\beta$, while this DRS becomes unstable and flow reversals happen with the increase of $\beta$. This finding complements our previous study of flow reversals in tilted cells with $\Gamma$ = 1 and 2 [Wang et al., J. Fluid Mech. 849, 355-372 (2018)]. For relatively larger Pr, the flow gives way to a stable triple-roll state or an unstable triple-roll state for small $\beta$. Moreover, multiple states in the turbulent regime are found for Ra ≥ 108, between which the flow can or cannot switch. In the latter case, the Nu are different for the two states with the same number of convection rolls, but different orientations. It is found that the Nu($\beta$)/Nu(0) and Re($\beta$)/Re(0) dependence is strongly influenced by a combination of Ra and Pr. In the present system, we interestingly find that the earlier conclusion that Nu decreases with increasing $\beta$ close to $\beta$ = 90° for $\Gamma$ = 1 does not hold for the present $\Gamma$ = 0.5 case with small Pr.},

We focus on the structures and dynamics of the large-scale intermittent flow. Two quasi-stable flow patterns are identified: one consists of a main diagonal roll with two corner rolls; and the other of two horizontally stacked rolls. These stable flow structures are associated with two types of events, which involve corner flow growth and pattern rotation: reversals, when the main roll rapidly switches signs; and cessations, when it disappears for longer periods. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied independently to the velocity field and to the temperature field. In both cases, three principal modes were identified: a single-roll, large-scale circulation; a quadrupolar flow; and a double-roll, symmetry-breaking mode. The large-scale circulation is the kinetic mode with the highest energy. The most energetic temperature mode is associated with the mean temperature and corresponds to a velocity field of quadrupolar nature. The vertical heat flux is concentrated in these two modes. The reversal process is characterized by sharp fluctuations in the amplitudes of all modes. Analysis of the interaction coefficients between the spatial modes leads us to propose a three-dimensional model, based on the interaction of the large-scale circulation, the quadrupolar flow and horizontal rolls. The main dynamics and time scales of reversals and cessations are reproduced by the model in the presence of noise. },

Relatively few experimental studies have been carried out on the fluid mechanics of supercritical flows because of the technical difficulties of dealing with turbulent flows and high heat fluxes simultaneously. Conversely, many computational fluid dynamics studies have examined a number of low-Reynolds-number turbulence models. However, none have reproduced the buoyancy production of turbulence reasonably well because of limitations with the use of a constant turbulent Prandtl number.

Some of the most active developments include the entropic LB method and the application of the LB method to turbulent flow, multiphase flow, and deformable particle and fiber suspensions. Hybrid methods based on the combination of the Eulerian lattice with a Lagrangian grid system for the simulation of moving deformable boundaries show promise for more efficient applications to a broader class of problems. We also discuss higher-order boundary conditions and the simulation of microchannel flow with finite Knudsen number. Additionally, the remarkable scalability of the LB method for parallel processing is shown with examples. Teraflop simulations with the LB method are routine, and there is no doubt that this method will be one of the first candidates for petaflop computational fluid dynamics in the near future.},

Fluctuations are maintained by the unceasing conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. Although the dynamics of turbulent fluctuations is ruled by the same equations controlling the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, here only phenomenological theories are currently available. The present review provides an overview of the most relevant (and often contrasting) theoretical approaches to Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence together with numerical and experimental evidence for their support.

abstract = {Computational methods have been extended recently to allow for the presence of moving contact lines in simulated two-phase flows. The predictive capability offered by these methods is potentially large, joining theoretical and experimental methods. Several challenges rather unique to this area need to be overcome, however, notably regarding the conditions near a moving contact line and the very large separation of length scales in these flows. We first summarize the main models for moving contact lines and follow with an overview of computational methods that includes direct continuum approaches and macroscale models that resolve only the large-scale flow by modeling the effects of the conditions near the contact line using theory. Results are presented for contact-line motion on ideal as well as patterned and grooved surfaces and for extensions to account for complexities such as thermocapillarity and phase change.},

abstract = {Similar to other renewable energy sources, wind energy is characterized by a low power density. Hence, for wind energy to make considerable con- tributions to the world's overall energy supply, large wind farms (on- and offshore) consisting of arrays of ever larger wind turbines are being envi- sioned and built. From a fluid mechanics perspective, wind farms encompass turbulent flow phenomena occurring at many spatial and temporal scales. Of particular interest to understanding mean power extraction and fluctuations in wind farms are the scales ranging from 1 to 10mthat comprise the wakes behind individual wind turbines, to motions reaching 100 m to kilometers in scale, inherently associated with the atmospheric boundary layer. In this review, we summarize current understanding of these flow phenomena (par- ticularly mean and second-order statistics) through field studies, wind tunnel experiments, large-eddy simulations, and analytical modeling, emphasizing the most relevant features for wind farm design and operation.},

abstract = {Fluid–structure interaction is ubiquitous in nature and occurs at all biological scales. Immersed methods provide mathematical and computational frameworks for modeling fluid–structure systems. These methods, which typically use an Eulerian description of the fluid and a Lagrangian description of the structure, can treat thin immersed boundaries and volumetric bodies, and they can model structures that are flexible or rigid or that move with prescribed deformational kinematics. Immersed formulations do not require body-fitted discretizations and thereby avoid the frequent grid regeneration that can otherwise be required for models involving large deformations and displacements. This article reviews immersed methods for both elastic structures and structures with prescribed kinematics. It considers formulations using integral operators to connect the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames and methods that directly apply jump conditions along fluid–structure interfaces. Benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, and selected applications at Reynolds numbers up to approximately 20,000 highlight their impact in biological and biomedical modeling and simulation.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, Volume 52 is January 5, 2020.

abstract = {Lakes and other confined water bodies are not exposed to tides, and their wind forcing is usually much weaker compared to ocean basins and estuaries. Hence, convective processes are often the dominant drivers for shaping mixing and stratification structures in inland waters. Due to the diverse environments of lakes—defined by local morphological, geochemical, and meteorological conditions, among others—a fascinating variety of convective processes can develop with remarkably unique signatures. Whereas the classical cooling-induced and shear-induced convections are well-known phenomena due to their dominant roles in ocean basins, other convective processes are specific to lakes and often overlooked, for example, sidearm, under-ice, and double-diffusive convection or thermobaric instability and bioconvection. Additionally, the peculiar properties of the density function at low salinities/temperatures leave distinctive traces. In this review, we present these various processes and connect observations with theories and model results.},

Particular emphasis is given to modeling the induced turbulent mixing and its impact in various astrophys-ical applications. The nonlinear saturation of fingering convection at low Prandtl number usually drives small-scale turbulent motions whose transport properties can be predicted reasonably accurately using a simple semi-analytical model. In some instances, large-scale internal gravity waves can be excited by a collective instability and eventually cause layering. The nonlin-ear saturation of oscillatory double-diffusive convection exhibits much more complex behavior. Weakly stratified systems always spontaneously transition into layered convection associated with very efficient mixing. More strongly stratified systems remain dominated by weak wave turbulence unless they are initialized into a layered state. The effects of rotation, shear, lateral gradients, and magnetic fields are briefly discussed.},

@article{Grossmann2016,
abstract = {Taylor-Couette flow -- the flow between two coaxial co- or counter-rotating cylinders -- is one of the paradigmatic systems in physics of fluids. The (dimensionless) control parameters are the Reynolds numbers of the inner and outer cylinder, the ratio of the cylinder radii, and the aspect ratio. The response of the system is the torque required to retain constant angular velocities, which can be connected to the angular velocity transport through the gap. While the low Reynolds number regime has been very well explored in the '80s and '90s of the last century, in the fully turbulent regime major research activity only developed in the last decade. In this paper we review this recent progress in our understanding of fully developed Taylor-Couette turbulence, from the experimental, numerical, and theoretical point of view. We will focus on the parameter dependence of the global torque and on the local flow organisation, including velocity profiles and boundary layers. Next, we will discuss transitions between different (turbulent) flow states. We will also elaborate on the relevance of this system for astrophysical disks (Keplerian flows). The review ends with a list of challenges for future research on turbulent Taylor-Couette flow. The published version in ARFM: Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 48:53-80 (2016).},

abstract = {Fundamental interactions are either fully or nearly symmetric under time reversal. But macroscopic phenomena have a definite arrow of time. Though there is no convergence on the origin of time's preferential direction, many researchers believe that the direction of time is towards increasing entropy. In this paper, we provide an alternate point of view. In driven-dissipative nonequilibrium systems forced at large scale, the energy flows from large scales to dissipative scales. This generic and multiscale process breaks time reversal symmetry and principle of detailed balance, thus can yield an arrow of time. In this paper we propose that conversion of large-scale coherence to small-scales incoherence could be treated as a dissipation mechanism for generic physical systems. We illustrate the above processes using turbulence as an example. We argue that the above picture of time irreversibility could be employed to the universe and to many-body quantum systems.},

The flow is found to be steady-state or oscillating depending on the strengths of the heating and magnetic field. A parametric study of the instability leading to the oscillations is performed.

The TNTI layer that separates the turbulent and non-turbulent regions exists at the edge of free shear turbulent flows and turbulent boundary layers, and comprises both the viscous superlayer and turbulent sublayer regions. The computation of    {\$}C{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D700{\}}{\}}{\$}   is made possible by the introduction of an original procedure, based on local volume averages within spheres of radius    {\$}r{\$}   , combined with conditional sampling as a function of the location with respect to the TNTI layer. The new procedure allows for a detailed investigation of the scale dependence of several turbulent quantities near the TNTI layer. An important achievement of this procedure consists in permitting the computation of the turbulent integral scale within the TNTI layer, which is shown to be approximately constant. Both the non-dimensional dissipation rate and turbulent Reynolds number    {\$}Re{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D706{\}}{\}}{\$}   vary in space within the TNTI layer, where two relations are observed:    {\$}C{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D700{\}}{\}}\backslashsim Re{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D706{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}   and    {\$}C{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D700{\}}{\}}\backslashsim Re{\_}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D706{\}}{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}   .

abstract = {First-principle-based prediction of mean-flow quantities of wall-bounded turbulent flows (channel, pipe and turbulent boundary layer (TBL)) is of great importance from both physics and engineering standpoints. Here we present a symmetry-based approach which yields analytical expressions for the mean-velocity profile (MVP) from a Lie-group analysis. After verifying the dilatation-group invariance of the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equation in the presence of a wall, we depart from previous Lie-group studies of wall turbulence by selecting a stress length function as a similarity variable. We argue that this stress length function characterizes the symmetry property of wall flows having a simple dilatation-invariant form. Three kinds of (local) invariant forms of the length function are postulated, a combination of which yields a multi-layer formula giving its distribution in the entire flow region normal to the wall and hence also the MVP, using the mean-momentum equation. In particular, based on this multi-layer formula, we obtain analytical expressions for the (universal) wall function and separate wake functions for pipe and channel, which are validated by data from direct numerical simulations (DNS). In conclusion, an analytical expression for the entire MVP of wall turbulence, beyond the log law or power law, is developed in this paper and the theory can be used to describe the mean turbulent kinetic-energy distribution, as well as a variety of boundary conditions such as pressure gradient, wall roughness, buoyancy, etc. where the dilatation-group invariance is valid in the wall-normal direction.},

abstract = {The AFiD code, an open source solver for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations (http://www.afid.eu), has been ported to GPU clusters to tackle large-scale wall-bounded turbulent flow simulations. The GPU porting has been carried out in CUDA Fortran with the extensive use of kernel loop directives (CUF kernels) in order to have a source code as close as possible to the original CPU version; just a few routines have been manually rewritten. A new transpose scheme has been devised to improve the scaling of the Poisson solver, which is the main bottleneck of incompressible solvers. For large meshes the GPU version of the code shows good strong scaling characteristics, and the wall-clock time per step for the GPU version is an order of magnitude smaller than for the CPU version of the code. Due to the increased performance and efficient use of memory, the GPU version of AFiD can perform simulations in parameter ranges that are unprecedented in thermally-driven wall-bounded turbulence. To verify the accuracy of the code, turbulent Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection and plane Couette flow are simulated and the results are in excellent agreement with the experimental and computational data that have been published in literature.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} We perform direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel flow with a lubricated micro-grooved surface to investigate the effects of this surface on the slip characteristics at the interface and the friction drag. The interface between water and lubricant is assumed to be flat, i.e. the surface-tension effect is neglected. The solid substrate, where a lubricant is infused, is composed of straight longitudinal grooves. The flow rate of water inside the channel is maintained constant, and a lubricant layer under the interface is shear driven by the turbulent water flow above. A turbulent channel flow with a superhydrophobic (i.e. air-lubricated) surface having the same solid substrate configuration is also simulated for comparison. The results show that the drag reduction with the liquid-infused surface highly depends on the lubricant viscosity as well as the groove width and aspect ratio. The amounts of drag reduction with the liquid-infused surfaces are not as good as those with superhydrophobic surfaces, but are still meaningfully large. For instance, the maximum drag reduction by the heptane-infused surface is approximately 13 {\%} for a rectangular groove whose spanwise width and depth in wall units are 12 and 14.4, respectively, whereas a superhydrophobic surface with the same geometry results in a drag reduction of 21 {\%}. The mean slip length normalized by the viscosity ratio and groove depth depends on the groove aspect ratio. The ratio of fluctuating spanwise slip length to the streamwise one is between 0.25 (ideal surface without groove structures) and 1 (i.e. isotropic slip), indicating that the slip is anisotropic. Using the Stokes flow assumption, the effective streamwise and spanwise slip lengths are expressed as a function of groove geometric parameters and lubricant viscosity. We also suggest a predictive model for drag reduction with the heptane-lubricated surface by combining the predicted effective slip lengths with the drag reduction formula used for riblets (Luchini {\textless}italic{\textgreater}et al.{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , {\textless}italic{\textgreater}J.

abstract = {Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection at large Rayleigh number is characterized by the presence of intense, vertically moving plumes. Both laboratory and numerical experiments reveal that the rising and descending plumes aggregate into separate clusters so as to produce large-scale updrafts and downdrafts. The horizontal scales of the aggregates reported so far have been comparable to the horizontal extent of the containers, but it has not been clear whether that represents a limitation imposed by domain size. In this work, we present numerical simulations of convection at sufficiently large aspect ratio to ascertain whether there is an intrinsic saturation scale for the clustering process when that ratio is large enough. From a series of simulations of Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection with Rayleigh numbers between 105 and 108 and with aspect ratios up to 12$\pi$, we conclude that the clustering process has a finite horizontal saturation scale with at most a weak dependence on Rayleigh number in the range studied. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spontaneous spin-up, i.e., the significant increase of the total angular momentum of a flow that initially has no net angular momentum, is very characteristic for decaying two-dimensional turbulence in square domains bounded by rigid no-slip walls. In contrast, spontaneous spin-up is virtually absent for such flows in a circular domain with a no-slip boundary. In order to acquire an understanding of this strikingly different behavior observed on the square and the circle, we consider a set of elliptic geometries with a gradual increase of the eccentricity. It is shown that a variation of the eccentricity can be used as a control parameter to tune the relative contribution of the pressure and viscous stresses in the angular momentum balance. Direct numerical simulations demonstrate that the magnitude of the torque can be related to the relative contribution of the pressure. As a consequence, the number of spin-up events in an ensemble of slightly different initial conditions depends strongly on the eccentricity. For small eccentricities, strong and rapid spin-up events are observed occasionally, whereas the majority of the runs do not show significant spin-up. Small differences in the initial condition can result in a completely different evolution of the flow and an appearance of the end state of the decay process. For sufficiently large eccentricities, all the runs in the ensemble demonstrate strong and rapid spin-up, which is consistent with the flow development on the square. It is verified that the number of spin-up events for a given eccentricity does not depend on the Reynolds number of the flow. This observation is consistent with the conjecture that it is the pressure on the domain boundaries that drives the spin-up processes.},

abstract = {The spontaneous self-organization of two-dimensional magnetized plasma is investigated within the framework of magnetohydrodynamics with a particular emphasis on the symmetry-breaking induced by the shape of the confining boundaries.

abstract = { Rotating Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection is typified by a variety of regimes with very distinct flow morphologies that originate from several instability mechanisms. Here we present results from direct numerical simulations of three representative set-ups: first, a fluid with Prandtl number {\$}Pr=6.4{\$} , corresponding to water, in a cylinder with a diameter-to-height aspect ratio of {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6E4{\}}=2{\$} ; second, a fluid with {\$}Pr=0.8{\$} , corresponding to {\$}\backslashtext{\{}SF{\}}{\_}{\{}6{\}}{\$} or air, confined in a slender cylinder with {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6E4{\}}=0.5{\$} ; and third, the main focus of this paper, a fluid with {\$}Pr=0.025{\$} , corresponding to a liquid metal, in a cylinder with {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6E4{\}}=1.87{\$} . The obtained flow fields are analysed using the sparsity-promoting variant of the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). By means of this technique, we extract the coherent structures that govern the dynamics of the flow, as well as their associated frequencies. In addition, we follow the temporal evolution of single modes and present a criterion to identify their direction of travel, i.e. whether they are precessing prograde or retrograde. We show that for moderate {\$}Pr{\$} a few dynamic modes suffice to accurately describe the flow. For large aspect ratios, these are wall-localised waves that travel retrograde along the periphery of the cylinder. Their DMD frequencies agree with the predictions of linear stability theory. With increasing Rayleigh number {\$}Ra{\$} , the interior gradually fills with columnar vortices, and eventually a regular pattern of convective Taylor columns prevails. For small aspect ratios and close enough to onset, the dominant flow structures are body modes that can precess either prograde or retrograde. For {\$}Pr=0.8{\$} , DMD additionally unveiled the existence of so far unobserved low-amplitude oscillatory modes. Furthermore, we elucidate the multi-modal character of oscillatory convection in low- {\$}Pr{\$} fluids. Generally, more dynamic modes must be retained to accurately approximate the flow. Close to onset, the flow is purely oscillatory and the DMD reveals that these high-frequency modes are a superposition of oscillatory columns and cylinder-scale inertial waves. We find that there are coexisting prograde and retrograde modes, as well as quasi-axisymmetric torsional modes. For higher {\$}Ra{\$} , the flow also becomes unstable to wall modes. These low-frequency modes can both coexist with the oscillatory modes, and also couple to them. However, the typical flow feature of rotating convection at moderate {\$}Pr{\$} , the quasi-steady Taylor vortices, is entirely absent in low- {\$}Pr{\$} flows. },

We discuss how a set of equations can be derived for the problem and how these equations can be solved numerically by an iterative scheme. By carrying out such a scheme, we find that the effect of the polymers is equivalent to producing a space-dependent effective viscosity that first increases from the zero-shear value at the plate then decreases rapidly back to the zero-shear value far from the plate. We further show that such an effective viscosity leads to a decrease in the streamwise velocity near the plate, which in turn leads to a reduction in heat transport. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

The KO scaling for the velocity field in zero-Prandtl number and low-Prandtl number convection is because of the weak buoyancy in the inertial range (buoyancy is active only at the very low wave numbers). We also observe that for intermediate Prandtl numbers (P=0.2) the KO scaling fits better with the numerical results than the Bolgiano-Obukhov (BO) scaling. For large Prandtl number (P=6.8), the spectra and flux results are somewhat inconclusive on the validity of the KO or BO scaling, yet the BO scaling is preferred over the KO scaling for these cases.

abstract = {The absorption of light or radiation drives turbulent convection inside stars, supernovae, frozen lakes, and Earth's mantle. In these contexts, the goal of laboratory and numerical studies is to determine the relation between the internal temperature gradients and the heat flux transported by the turbulent flow. This is the constitutive law of turbulent convection, to be input into large-scale models of such natural flows. However, in contrast with the radiative heating of natural flows, laboratory experiments have focused on convection driven by heating and cooling plates; the heat transport is then severely restricted by boundary layers near the plates, which prevents the realization of the mixing length scaling law used in evolution models of geophysical and astrophysical flows. There is therefore an important discrepancy between the scaling laws measured in laboratory experiments and those used, e.g., in stellar evolution models. Here we provide experimental and numerical evidence that radiatively driven convection spontaneously achieves the mixing length scaling regime, also known as the "ultimate" regime of thermal convection. This constitutes a clear observation of this regime of turbulent convection. Our study therefore bridges the gap between models of natural flows and laboratory experiments. It opens an experimental avenue for a priori determinations of the constitutive laws to be implemented into models of geophysical and astrophysical flows, as opposed to empirical fits of these constitutive laws to the scarce observational data.},

abstract = { We report on the transition between two regimes of heat transport in a radiatively driven convection experiment, where a fluid gets heated up within a tunable heating length    {\$}\backslashell{\$}   in the vicinity of the bottom of the tank. The first regime is similar to that observed in standard Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard experiments, the Nusselt number    {\$}Nu{\$}   being related to the Rayleigh number    {\$}Ra{\$}   through the power law    {\$}Nu\backslashsim Ra{\^{}}{\{}1/3{\}}{\$}   . The second regime corresponds to the ‘ultimate' or mixing-length scaling regime of thermal convection, where    {\$}Nu{\$}   varies as the square root of    {\$}Ra{\$}   . Evidence for these two scaling regimes has been reported in Lepot et al.  ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.

We propose a simple model describing radiatively driven convection in the mixing-length regime. It leads to the scaling relation    {\$}Nu\backslashsim (\backslashell /H)Pr{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}Ra{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}}{\$}   , where    {\$}H{\$}   is the height of the cell and    {\$}Pr{\$}   is the Prandtl number, thereby allowing us to deduce the values of    {\$}Ra{\$}   and    {\$}Nu{\$}   at which the system transitions from one regime to the other.

Here, by solving analytically the Navier-Stokes equations with partial slip boundary conditions at the solid-fluid interface, we develop a theoretical approach justifying and extending these earlier findings. We show in particular that in the perfect-slip regime, the abovementioned results are, in the plane-plane configuration, very general and robust with respect to lever geometry considerations. We compare the results to those obtained previously for the sphere moving perpendicularly and close to a plane in a simple fluid and discuss in more details the differences concerning the dependence of the friction forces with the gap distance separating the moving object (i.e., plane or sphere) from the fixed plane. We show that the plane-plane geometry is more sensitive than the sphere-plane geometry for the measurement of slippage coefficients. Finally, we show that the submicron fluidic effect reported in the reference above, and discussed further in the present work, can have dramatic implications in the design of nanoelectromechanical systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.},

Rapid advances in microelectromechanical systems have stimulated the development of compact devices, which require effective cooling technologies (e.g., microchannel cooling). However, the inconsistencies between experimental and classical theoretical predictions for the liquid flow in microchannel remain unclarified. Given the larger surface/volume ratio of microchannel, the surface effects increase as channel scale decreases. Here we show the scale effect of the boundary condition at the solid-liquid interface on single-phase convective heat transfer characteristics in microchannels. We demonstrate that the deviation from classical theory with a reduction in hydraulic diameters is due to the breakdown of the continuum solid-liquid boundary condition. The forced convective heat transfer characteristics of single-phase laminar flow in a parallel-plate microchannel are investigated. Using the theoretical Poiseuille and Nusselt numbers derived under the slip boundary condition at the solid-liquid interface, we estimate the slip length and thermal slip length at the interface.},

For polymeric liquids, de Gennes predicted that the Navier boundary condition together with the theory of polymer dynamics imply extraordinarily large interfacial slip for entangled polymer melts on ideal surfaces; this Navier-de Gennes model was confirmed using dewetting experiments on ultra-smooth, low-energy substrates. Here, we use capillary leveling - surface tension driven flow of films with initially non-uniform thickness - of polymeric films on these same substrates. Measurement of the slip length from a robust one-parameter fit to a lubrication model is achieved. We show that at the lower shear rates involved in leveling experiments as compared to dewetting ones, the employed substrates can no longer be considered ideal. The data is instead consistent with physical adsorption of polymer chains at the solid/liquid interface. We extend the Navier-de Gennes description using one additional parameter, namely the density of physically adsorbed chains per unit surface. The resulting formulation is found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental observations.},

A visualization study, as well as local temperature measurements, shows that in spite of the lack of the cylindrical core, there also exists a large-scale circulation (LSC) in the annular system: thermal plumes organize themselves with the ascending hot plumes on one side and the descending cold plumes on the opposite side. Near the upper and lower plates, the mean flow moves along the two circular branches. Our results further reveal that the dynamics of the LSC in this annular geometry is different from that in the traditional cylindrical cell, i.e. the orientation of the LSC oscillates in a narrow azimuthal angle range, and no cessations, reversals or net rotation were detected. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We observe bistability with weak- and strong-magnetic-field branches. Both the dynamo branches undergo subcritical dynamo transition. We also observe a host of dynamo states including constant, periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic magnetic fields. One of the chaotic states originates through a quasiperiodic route with phase locking, while the other chaotic attractor appears to follow the Newhouse-Ruelle-Takens route to chaos. We also observe intermittent transitions between quasiperiodic and chaotic states for a given Taylor-Green forcing. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We employ detailed numerical simulations to probe the mechanism of flow reversals in two-dimensional turbulent convection. We show that the reversals occur via a vortex reconnection of two attracting corner rolls having the same sign of vorticity, thus leading to major restructuring of the flow. Large fluctuations in heat transport are observed during the reversal due to the flow reconfiguration. The flow configurations during the reversals have been analyzed quantitatively using large-scale modes. Using these tools, we also show why flow reversals occur for a restricted range of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Dual-beam intensity cross-correlation spectroscopy is used to measure the viscous boundary layer over a rough conducting surface in turbulent convection in water. It is found that the velocity boundary layer near the rough surface can be characterized by three quantities: the maximum velocity $\nu$ m , the shear rate $\gamma$ $\nu$ and the total boundary layer thickness d + $\delta$ $\nu$ ; all of them obey power laws of Rayleigh number Ra. The maximum velocity v m is located outside the rough surface and its numerical value remains the same as that in the smooth cell. The Ra-dependence of d + $\delta$ $\nu$ is found to be the same as that in the smooth cell, but the power-law amplitude is increased by a factor close to 2. Because of the formation of small eddies inside the roughening grooves, the measured $\gamma$ $\nu$ is reduced considerably in the groove region. It is also found that the Nusselt number Nu ∼ Ra 0.35 , which is larger in both magnitude and scaling exponent as compared to the smooth case. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

abstract = {Three criteria are deduced for the prediction of grids, which allow for accurate direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows. These criteria are based on wavelength considerations, boundary layer thickness estimates, and on a simplified theoretical model to calculate the coefficient of a verified subgrid-scale heat flux model. The criteria have been successfully tested by comparing the results of several three-dimensional and time-dependent numerical simulations for the Rayleigh-Benard convection of air in an infinite channel up to Ra = 381,225. Numerical results deduced from appropriate grids are in agreement with adequate experimental data. Numerical results deduced from insufficient grids show only weak deficiencies. The most sensitive data to restricted large wavelengths are the calculated Nusselt numbers and the flow regimes in the laminar-turbulent transition range; data sensitive to insufficient vertical resolution near the walls are also the Nusselt numbers; and data sensitive to insufficient horizontal resolution are the calculated Nusselt numbers and rms values of velocity and temperature fluctuations at large Rayleigh numbers. All three criteria use data specific to the type of flow only as input parameters. Therefore, these criteria may also be used for other types of flows. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The fundamental challenge to characterize and quantify thermal transport in the strongly nonlinear regime of Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection – the buoyancy-driven flow of a horizontal layer of fluid heated from below – has perplexed the fluid dynamics community for decades. Rayleigh proposed controlling the temperature of thermally conducting boundaries in order to study the onset of convection, in which case vertical heat transport gauges the system response. Conflicting experimental results for ostensibly similar set-ups have confounded efforts to discriminate between two competing theories for how boundary layers and interior flows interact to determine transport through the convecting layer asymptotically far beyond onset. In a conceptually new approach, Bouillaut, Lepot, Auma{\^{i}}tre and Gallet ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}J. Fluid Mech.{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , vol. 861, 2019, R5) devised a procedure to radiatively heat a portion of the fluid domain bypassing rigid conductive boundaries and allowing for dissociation of thermal and viscous boundary layers. Their experiments reveal a new level of complexity in the problem suggesting that heat transport scaling predictions of both theories may be realized depending on details of the thermal forcing. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

High-density lipoprotein particle concentration (HDL-P) may better predict CHD. However, the impact of race/ethnicity on the relations between HDL-P and subclinical atherosclerosis and incident CHD events has not been described. Participants from the Dallas Heart Study (DHS), a multiethnic, probability-based, population cohort of Dallas County adults, underwent the following baseline measurements: HDL-C, HDL-P by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, and coronary artery calcium by electron-beam computed tomography. Participants were followed for a median of 9.3 years for incident CHD events (composite of first myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death). The study comprised 1,977 participants free of CHD (51{\%} women, 46{\%} black). In adjusted models, HDL-C was not associated with prevalent coronary artery calcium (p = 0.13) or incident CHD overall (hazard ratio [HR] per 1 SD 0.89, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.05). However, HDL-C was inversely associated with incident CHD among nonblack (adjusted HR per 1 SD 0.67, 95{\%} CI 0.46 to 0.97) but not black participants (HR 0.94, 95{\%} CI 0.78 to 1.13, pinteraction = 0.05). Conversely, HDL-P, adjusted for risk factors and HDL-C, was inversely associated with prevalent coronary artery calcium (p = 0.009) and with incident CHD overall (adjusted HR per 1 SD 0.73, 95{\%} CI 0.62 to 0.86), with no interaction by black race/ethnicity (pinteraction = 0.57). In conclusion, in contrast to HDL-C, the inverse relation between HDL-P and incident CHD events is consistent across ethnicities. These findings suggest that HDL-P is superior to HDL-C in predicting prevalent atherosclerosis as well as incident CHD events across a diverse population and should be considered as a therapeutic target.},

abstract = {Acute lung injury is characterized by hypoxemia due to pulmonary ventilation/perfusion-mismatching. I.v. administered prostaglandin E1 (PGE1), a vasodilator with a high pulmonary clearance, has been studied in acute lung injury. Inhalation of the vasodilators nitric oxide and prostacyclin improved oxygenation by selective dilation of the pulmonary vasculature in ventilated lung areas. In the present study, PGE1 inhalation was used for treatment of acute lung injury. Fifteen patients with acute lung injury defined as PaO2/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) {\textless}160 mm Hg were treated with PGE1 inhalation in addition to standard intensive care. The drug was continuously delivered via a pneumatic nebulizer. Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation system II and multiple organ failure scores were (mean +/- SEM) 33 +/- 2 and 10 +/- 0.3, respectively. Inhaled PGE1 was administered for 103 +/- 17 h at a dose of 41 +/- 2 microg/h. The PaO2/FIO2 ratio increased from 105 +/- 9 to 160 +/- 17 mm Hg (P {\textless} 0.05) and to 189 +/- 25 mm Hg (P {\textless} 0.05) after 4 h and 24 h, respectively. PGE1 inhalation decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure and central venous pressure were not statistically significant. Mean arterial pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac output, and heart rate remained unchanged. Intensive care unit mortality was 40{\%}. The present data suggest that inhaled PGE1 is an effective therapeutic option for improving oxygenation in patients with acute lung injury. Whether inhaled PGE1 will increase survival in acute lung injury should be investigated in a controlled prospective trial. IMPLICATIONS: In patients with severe acute lung injury and multiple organ failure, inhaled prostaglandin E1 improved oxygenation and decreased venous admixture without affecting systemic hemodynamic variables. Controlled clinical trials are warranted.},

abstract = {The high-order statistics of fluctuations in velocity gradients in the crossover range from the inertial to the Kolmogorov and sub-Kolmogorov scales are studied by direct numerical simulations (DNS) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence with vastly improved resolution. The derivative moments for orders 0 n 8 are represented well as powers of the Reynolds number, Re, in the range 380 Re 5725, where Re is based on the periodic box length Lx. These low-Reynolds-number flows give no hint of scaling in the inertial range even when extended self-similarity is applied. Yet, the DNS scaling exponents of velocity gradients agree well with those deduced, using a recent theory of anomalous scaling, from the scaling exponents of the longitudinal structure functions at infinitely high Reynolds numbers. This suggests that the asymptotic state of turbulence is attained for the velocity gradients at far lower Reynolds numbers than those required for the inertial range to appear. We discuss these findings in the light of multifractal formalism. Our numerical studies also resolve the crossover of the velocity gradient statistics from the Gaussian to non-Gaussian behaviour that occurs as the Reynolds number is increased.},

They are analyzed by numerical simulations of turbulent convection in fluids at different Prandtl number ranging from 0.005 to 70 and for Rayleigh numbers up to {\$}10{\^{}}7{\$}. For each case, we identify characteristic scales and times that separate the fast, small-scale turbulent fluctuations from the gradually changing large-scale superstructures. The characteristic scales of the large-scale patterns, which change with Prandtl and Rayleigh number, are also found to be correlated with the boundary layer dynamics, and in particular the clustering of thermal plumes at the top and bottom plates. Our analysis suggests a scale separation and thus the existence of a simplified description of the turbulent superstructures in geo- and astrophysical settings.},

Burnishing process is a post-machining operation in which the surface of the workpiece is compressed by the application of a ball or roller to produce a smooth and work-hardened surface by plastic deformation of surface irregularities. In the present study, simple and inexpensive burnishing tools, with interchangeable adapter for ball and roller were designed and fabricated to meet the requirements of the present study. Then, ball burnishing processes were carried out on aluminium 6061 under different parameters and different burnishing orientations to investigate the role of burnishing speed, burnishing force and burnishing tool dimension on the surface qualities and tribological properties. The results showed that burnishing speed of 330rpm and burnishing force of 160N produce optimum results. Meanwhile, a decrease in the burnishing ball diameter leads to a considerable improvement in the surface roughness up to 75{\%}. On the other hand, parallel burnishing orientation exhibits lower friction coefficient compared to cross burnishing orientation. Furthermore, ball burnishing process is capable of improving friction coefficient by 48{\%} reduction and weight loss by 60-80{\%} reduction of burnished surface of Aluminum 6061. These findings are further supplemented by the surface features as seen in SEM photomicrographs.},

abstract = {AbstractThe heterogeneously heated free Convective Boundary Layer (CBL) is investigated by means of dimensional analysis and results from Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). The investigated physical model is a CBL that forms in a linearly stratified atmosphere heated from the surface by square patches with a high surface buoyancy flux. Each simulation has been run long enough to show the formation of a peak in kinetic energy, corresponding to the “optimal” heterogeneity size with strong secondary circulations, and the subsequent transition into a horizontally homogeneous CBL.Scaling laws for the time of the optimal state and transition, and for the vertically integrated kinetic energy (KE) have been developed. The laws show that the optimal state and transition do not occur at a fixed ratio of the heterogeneity size to the CBL height. Instead, these occur at a higher ratio for simulations with increasing heterogeneity sizes, due to the development of structures in the downward moving air that grow faster than the CBL thickness. The moment of occurrence of the optimal state and transition are strongly related to the heterogeneity amplitude: stronger amplitudes result in an earlier optimal state and a later transition. Furthermore, a decrease in patch size combined with a compensating increase in patch surface buoyancy flux to maintain the energy input, results in decreasing KE and a later transition. Our simulations suggest that a CBL with a heterogeneity size smaller than the initial CBL height has less entrainment than a horizontally homogeneous CBL, whereas one with a larger heterogeneity size has more.},

Since the size of this shell is well below what large-eddy simulations can resolve, the authors have performed direct numerical simulations of an idealized subsiding shell. The system develops a self-similar, Reynolds number–independent flow that allows for the determination of explicit scaling laws relating the characteristic length, time, and velocity scales of the shell. It is found that the shell width grows quadratically in time, linearly with the traveled distance. The magnitude of these growth rates shows that evaporative cooling, in its most idealized form, is capable of producing a fast-growing shell with numbers that are consistent with observations of the subsiding shell around real shallow cumulus clouds: for typical thermodynamic conditions in cumulus clouds, a velocity on the order of 1 m s−1 and a thickness on the order of 10 m are estab...},

abstract = {AbstractThe growth and decay of a convective boundary layer (CBL) over a surface with a constant surface temperature that develops into a linear stratification is studied, and a mathematical model for this system is derived. The study is based on direct numerical simulations with four different Reynolds numbers; the two simulations with the largest Reynolds numbers display Reynolds number similarity, suggesting that the results can be extrapolated to the atmosphere. Because of the interplay of the growing CBL and the gradually decreasing surface buoyancy flux, the system has a complex time evolution in which integrated kinetic energy, buoyancy flux, and dissipation peak and subsequently decay. The derived model provides characteristic scales for bulk properties of the CBL. Even though the system is unsteady, self-similar vertical profiles of buoyancy, buoyancy flux, and velocity variances are recovered. There are two important implications for atmospheric modeling. First, the magnitude of the surface buoyancy flux sets the time scale of the system; thus, over a rough surface the roughness length is a key variable. Therefore, the performance of the surface model is crucial in large-eddy simulations of convection over water surfaces. Second, during the phase in which kinetic energy decays, the integrated kinetic energy never follows a power law, because the buoyancy flux and dissipation balance until the kinetic energy has almost vanished. Therefore, the applicability of power-law decay models to the afternoon transition in the atmospheric boundary layer is questionable; the presented model provides a physically sound alternative.},

abstract = {AbstractA numerical experiment is designed to study the interaction at the stratocumulus top between a mean vertical shear and the buoyancy reversal due to evaporative cooling, without radiative cooling. Direct numerical simulation is used to eliminate the uncertainty introduced by turbulence models. It is found that the enhancement by shear-induced mixing of the turbulence caused by buoyancy reversal can render buoyancy reversal comparable to other forcing mechanisms. However, it is also found that (i) the velocity jump across the capping inversion $\Delta$u needs to be relatively large and values of about 1 m s−1 that are typically associated with the convective motions inside the boundary layer are generally too small and (ii) there is no indication of cloud-top entrainment instability. To obtain these results, parameterizations of the mean entrainment velocity and the relevant time scales are derived from the study of the cloud-top vertical structure. Two overlapping layers can be identified: a background shear layer with a thickness (⅓)($\Delta$u)2/$\Delta$b, where $\Delta$b is the buoyancy increment across the capping inversion and a turbulence layer dominated by free convection inside the cloud and by shear production inside the relatively thin overlap region. As turbulence intensifies, the turbulence layer encroaches into the background shear layer and defines thereby the entrainment velocity. Particularized to the first research flight of the Second Dynamics and Chemistry of the Marine Stratocumulus (DYCOMS II) field campaign, the analysis predicts an entrainment velocity of about 3 mm s−1 after 5–10 min—a velocity comparable to the measurements and thus indicative of the relevance of mean shear in that case.},

abstract = {AbstractDirect numerical simulation and laboratory experiments are used to investigate turbulent convection beneath a horizontal ice–water interface. Scaling laws are derived that quantify the dependence of the melt rate of the ice on the far-field temperature of the water under purely thermally driven conditions. The scaling laws, the simulations, and the laboratory experiments consistently yield that the melt rate increases by two orders of magnitude, from ⋍101 to ⋍103 mm day−1, as the far-field temperature increases from 4° to 8°C. The strong temperature dependence of the melt rate is explained by analyzing the vertical structure of the flow: For far-field temperatures below 8°C, the flow features a stably stratified, diffusive layer next to the ice that shields it from the warmer, turbulent outer layer. The stratification in the diffusive layer diminishes as the far-field temperature increases and vanishes for far-field temperatures far above 8°C.

Turbulence arises in the late stage of the instability evolution as a result of the proliferation of active scales of motion. Fluctuations are maintained by the unceasing conversion of potential energy into kinetic energy. Although the dynamics of turbulent fluctuations is ruled by the same equations controlling the Rayleigh–Taylor instability, here only phenomenological theories are currently available. The present review provides an overview of the most relevant (and often contrasting) theoretical approaches to Rayleigh–Taylor turbulence together with numerical and experimental evidence for their support. Although the focus is mainly on the classical Boussinesq Rayleigh–Taylor turbulence of miscible fluids, the review extends to other fluid systems with viscoelastic behavior, affected by rotation of the reference frame, and, finally, in the presence of reactions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We study the evolution of a melting front between the solid and liquid phases of a pure incompressible material where fluid motions are driven by unstable temperature gradients. In a plane-layer geometry, this can be seen as classical Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection where the upper solid boundary is allowed to melt due to the heat flux brought by the fluid underneath. This free-boundary problem is studied numerically in two dimensions using a phase-field approach, classically used to study the melting and solidification of alloys, which we dynamically couple with the Navier–Stokes equations in the Boussinesq approximation. The advantage of this approach is that it requires only moderate modifications of classical numerical methods. We focus on the case where the solid is initially nearly isothermal, so that the evolution of the topography is related to the inhomogeneous heat flux from thermal convection, and does not depend on the conduction problem in the solid. From a very thin stable layer of fluid, convection cells appear as the depth – and therefore the effective Rayleigh number – of the layer increases. The continuous melting of the solid leads to dynamical transitions between different convection cell sizes and topography amplitudes. The Nusselt number can be larger than its value for a planar upper boundary, due to the feedback of the topography on the flow, which can stabilize large-scale laminar convection cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We show that the large-scale circulation shares many similarities with the so-called vortex, or slow-mode, of forced rotating turbulence. Our investigations show that at a fixed rotation rate the large-scale vortex is only observed for a finite range of Rayleigh numbers, as the quasi-two-dimensional nature of the flow disappears at very high Rayleigh numbers. We observe slow vortex merging events and find a non-local inverse cascade of energy in addition to the regular direct cascade associated with fast small-scale turbulent motions. Finally, we show that cyclonic structures are dominant in the small-scale turbulent flow and this symmetry breaking persists in the large-scale vortex motion.},

A related but separate question is whether the measurements support the so-called Kraichnan law, according to which the Nusselt number varies as the square root of the Rayleigh number (modulo a logarithmic factor). Although there have been claims that the Kraichnan regime has been observed in laboratory experiments with low aspect ratios, the totality of existing experimental results presents a conflicting picture in the high-Rayleigh-number regime.

Thus, the log layer close to the rough wall depends on the roughness length scale, rather than on the viscous length scale.

The energy dissipation rate at the wall of an inner rough cylinder decreases significantly as a consequence of the wall shear stress reduction caused by the flow separation at the rough elements.

Compared to the purely smooth case, the inner wall roughness renders the system more bulk dominated and thus increases the effective scaling exponent.},

The two different orientations of LSCR give two quite different heat transport efficiencies, indicating that heat transport is sensitive to the LSCR direction over the asymmetric roughness structure. Through a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of thermal plume emissions and the orientation of the LSCR over the asymmetric structure, we provide a physical explanation for these findings. The current work has important implications for passive and active flow control in engineering, bio-fluid dynamics, and geophysical flows.},

abstract = {Computational codes for direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard (RB) convection are compared in terms of computational cost and quality of the solution. As a benchmark case, RB convection at Ra=108and Pr=1 in a periodic domain, in cubic and cylindrical containers is considered. A dedicated second-order finite-difference code (AFID/RBFLOW) and a specialized fourth-order finite-volume code (GOLDFISH) are compared with a general purpose finite-volume approach (OPENFOAM) and a general purpose spectral-element code (NEK5000). Reassuringly, all codes provide predictions of the average heat transfer that converge to the same values. The computational costs, however, are found to differ considerably. The specialized codes AFID/RBFLOW and GOLDFISH are found to excel in efficiency, outperforming the general purpose flow solvers NEK5000 and OPENFOAM by an order of magnitude with an error on the Nusselt number Nu below 5{\%}. However, we find that Nu alone is not sufficient to assess the quality of the numerical results: in fact, instantaneous snapshots of the temperature field from a near wall region obtained for deliberately under-resolved simulations using NEK5000 clearly indicate inadequate flow resolution even when Nu is converged. Overall, dedicated special purpose codes for RB convection are found to be more efficient than general purpose codes.},

abstract = {To predict the mean temperature profiles in turbulent thermal convection, the thermal boundary layer (BL) equation including the effects of fluctuations has to be solved. In Shishkina et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 114 (2015), the thermal BL equation with the fluctuations taken into account as an eddy thermal diffusivity has been solved for large Prandtl-number fluids for which the eddy thermal diffusivity and the velocity field can be approximated respectively as a cubic and a linear function of the distance from the plate. In the present work we make use of the idea of Prandtl's mixing length model and relate the eddy thermal diffusivity to the stream function. With this proposed relation, we can solve the thermal BL equation and obtain a closed-form expression for the dimensionless mean temperature profile in terms of two independent parameters for fluids with a general Prandtl number. With a proper choice of the parameters, our predictions of the temperature profiles are in excellent agreement with the results of our direct numerical simulations for a wide range of Prandtl numbers from 0.01 to 2547.9 and Rayleigh numbers from 10{\^{}}7 to 10{\^{}}9.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Background rotation causes different flow structures and heat transfer efficiencies in Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection. Three main regimes are known: rotation unaffected, rotation affected and rotation dominated. It has been shown that the transition between rotation-unaffected and rotation-affected regimes is driven by the boundary layers. However, the physics behind the transition between rotation-affected and rotation-dominated regimes are still unresolved. In this study, we employ the experimentally obtained Lagrangian velocity and acceleration statistics of neutrally buoyant immersed particles to study the rotation-affected and rotation-dominated regimes and the transition between them. We have found that the transition to the rotation-dominated regime coincides with three phenomena; suppressed vertical motions, strong penetration of vortical plumes deep into the bulk and reduced interaction of vortical plumes with their surroundings. The first two phenomena are used as confirmations for the available hypotheses on the transition to the rotation-dominated regime while the last phenomenon is a new argument to describe the regime transition. These findings allow us to better understand the rotation-dominated regime and the transition to this regime.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Two schemes are used for time stepping, a second-order implicit-explicit scheme based on the Crank-Nicolson and Adams-Bashforth method, and a fully-implicit {\^{I}}¸-method. The implicit system of nonlinear equations are solved using multigrid iteration with the SIMPLER method as smoother. In this paper, we describe the implemented multigrid method and investigate its efficiency and the robustness for different viscosity contrasts. Convergence tests showed that with a small modification of the SIMPLER method, the multigrid method exhibits a satisfactory convergence rate even for viscosity contrasts up to 109. Three cases of time-dependent thermally driven convection with viscosity contrasts up to 105 are considered and discussed and the multigrid method has demonstrated its robustness also for these cases. Further, we have also compared the computational efficiency of the two time stepping methods. It appeared that the fully-implicit scheme is a little more efficient than the implicit-explicit scheme for a constant viscosity and it was considerably more efficient for a viscosity contrast of 103},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection are performed in two-dimensional (2-D) square cavities with rough top and bottom plates. The roughness is introduced by setting heated/cooled rectangular elements called fins equidistantly onto lower/upper plates. The Rayleigh numbers (Ra) range from 107to 1010. Different numbers of fins (S) are used with Prandtl number (Pr) fixed to 1. The Pr effect is also investigated for fixed S=8, with Pr varied from 0.71 to 34.1. It is found that in all roughness configurations, the heat transport is significantly enhanced when Ra exceeds a critical value. The power-law scalings of the Nusselt number (Nu) versus Ra keep in change in the studied Ra range for all Pr and S, with most of the exponents within [1/3,1/2], larger than those in smooth cases. In addition, we find Nu increases monotonically with Pr when Pr⩾1 and Ra is moderate for S=8. The dynamics of plumes, the flow structures between the fins and in the bulk, as well as the turbulence dissipation rates are found to be greatly influenced by the presence of fins, which are responsible for the heat transport enhancement, as well as the change in Nu∼Ra power-law scalings.},

When both the temperature difference between the plates and the rotation rate are sufficiently large, a strong horizontal wind is generated that is perpendicular to both the rotation vector and the gravity vector. The wind is turbulent, large-scale, and vertically sheared. Horizontal anisotropy, engendered here by rotation, appears necessary for such wind generation. Most of the kinetic energy of the flow resides in the wind, and the vertical turbulent heat flux is much lower on average than when there is no wind.},

abstract = {We consider convection in an internally heated (IH) layer of fluid that is bounded below by a perfect insulator and above by a poor conductor. The poorly conducting boundary is modelled by a fixed heat flux. Using solely analytical methods, we find linear and energy stability thresholds for the static state, and we construct a lower bound on the mean temperature that applies to all flows. The linear stability analysis yields a Rayleigh number above which the static state is linearly unstable ( {\$}R{\_}{\{}L{\}}{\$} ), and the energy analysis yields a Rayleigh number below which it is globally stable ( {\$}R{\_}{\{}E{\}}{\$} ). For various boundary conditions on the velocity, exact expressions for {\$}R{\_}{\{}L{\}}{\$} and {\$}R{\_}{\{}E{\}}{\$} are found using long-wavelength asymptotics. Each {\$}R{\_}{\{}E{\}}{\$} is strictly smaller than the corresponding {\$}R{\_}{\{}L{\}}{\$} but is within 1 {\%}. The lower bound on the mean temperature is proven for no-slip velocity boundary conditions using the background method. The bound guarantees that the mean temperature of the fluid, relative to that of the top boundary, grows with the heating rate ( {\$}H{\$} ) no slower than {\$}H{\^{}}{\{}2/3{\}}{\$} .},

For the Prandtl numbers ({\$}Pr{\$}) between 1 and 10 simulated here, this large-scale shear can be induced by raising the Rayleigh number ({\$}Ra{\$}) sufficiently, and we explore the resulting convection for {\$}Ra{\$} up to {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$}. When present in our simulations, the sheared mean flow accounts for a large fraction of the total kinetic energy, and this fraction tends towards unity as {\$}Ra\backslashto\backslashinfty{\$}. The shear helps disperse convective structures, and it reduces vertical heat flux; in parameter regimes where one state with large-scale shear and one without are both stable, the Nusselt number of the state with shear is smaller and grows more slowly with {\$}Ra{\$}. When the large-scale shear is present with {\$}Pr\backslashlesssim2{\$}, the convection undergoes strong global oscillations on long timescales, and heat transport occurs in bursts. Nusselt numbers, time-averaged over these bursts, vary non-monotonically with {\$}Ra{\$} for {\$}Pr=1{\$}. When the shear is present with {\$}Pr\backslashgtrsim3{\$}, the flow does not burst, and convective heat transport is sustained at all times. Nusselt numbers then grow roughly as powers of {\$}Ra{\$}, but the growth rates are slower than any previously reported for Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'enard convection without large-scale shear. We find the Nusselt numbers grow proportionally to {\$}Ra{\^{}}{\{}0.077{\}}{\$} when {\$}Pr=3{\$} and to {\$}Ra{\^{}}{\{}0.19{\}}{\$} when {\$}Pr=10{\$}.

The kinetic energy balance is divided into a dissipation, a production and a flux term. We discuss the profiles of all the terms and find that the different contributions to the energy balance can be spatially separated into regions where kinetic energy is produced and where kinetic energy is dissipated. By analysing the Prandtl number dependence of the kinetic energy balance, we show that the height dependence of the mean viscous dissipation is closely related to the flux of kinetic energy. We show that the flux of kinetic energy can be divided into four additive contributions, each representing a different elementary physical process (advection, buoyancy, normal viscous stresses and viscous shear stresses). The behaviour of these individual flux contributions is found to be surprisingly rich and exhibits a pronounced Prandtl number dependence. Different flux contributions dominate the kinetic energy transport at different depths, such that a comprehensive discussion requires a decomposition of the domain into a considerable number of sublayers. On a less detailed level, our results reveal that advective kinetic energy fluxes play a key role in balancing the near-wall dissipation at low Prandtl number, whereas normal viscous stresses are particularly important at high Prandtl number. Finally, our work reveals that classical velocity boundary layers are deeply connected to the kinetic energy transport, but fail to correctly represent regions of enhanced viscous dissipation. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we argue that, independent of boundary conditions, systematic dissipation measurements in Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection capture the relevant near-wall structures. By means of direct numerical simulations with varying Prandtl numbers, we demonstrate that such dissipation layers share central characteristics with classical boundary layers, but, in contrast to the latter, can be extended naturally to arbitrary boundary conditions. We validate our approach by explaining differences in scaling behavior observed for no-slip and stress-free boundaries, thus paving the way to an extension of scaling theories developed for laboratory convection to a broad class of natural systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} We conduct direct numerical simulations for turbulent Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard (RB) convection, driven simultaneously by two scalar components (say, temperature and concentration) with different molecular diffusivities, and measure the respective fluxes and the Reynolds number. To account for the results, we generalize the Grossmann–Lohse theory for traditional RB convection (Grossmann {\&}amp; Lohse, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}J.

Our numerical results suggest that the generalized theory can successfully capture the overall trends for the fluxes of two scalars and the Reynolds number without introducing any new free parameters. In fact, for most of the parameter space explored here, the theory can even predict the absolute values of the fluxes and the Reynolds number with good accuracy. The current study extends the generality of the Grossmann–Lohse theory in the area of buoyancy-driven convection flows. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We study, using direct numerical simulations, the effect of geometrical confinement on heat transport and flow structure in Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'enard convection in fluids with different Prandtl numbers. Our simulations span over two decades of Prandtl number {\$}Pr{\$}, {\$}0.1 \backslashleq Pr \backslashleq 40{\$}, with the Rayleigh number {\$}Ra{\$} fixed at {\$}10{\^{}}8{\$}. The width-to-height aspect ratio {\$}\backslashGamma{\$} spans between {\$}0.025{\$} and {\$}0.25{\$} while the length-to-height aspect ratio is fixed at one. We first find that for {\$}Pr \backslashgeq 0.5{\$}, geometrical confinement can lead to a significant enhancement in heat transport as characterized by the Nusselt number {\$}Nu{\$}. For those cases, {\$}Nu{\$} is maximal at a certain {\$}\backslashGamma = \backslashGamma{\_}{\{}opt{\}}{\$}. It is found that {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}{\{}opt{\}}{\$} exhibits a power-law relation with {\$}Pr{\$} as {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}{\{}opt{\}}=0.11Pr{\^{}}{\{}-0.06{\}}{\$}, and the maximal relative enhancement generally increases with {\$}Pr{\$} over the explored parameter range. As opposed to the situation of {\$}Pr \backslashgeq 0.5{\$}, confinement-induced enhancement in {\$}Nu{\$} is not realized for smaller values of {\$}Pr{\$}, such as {\$}0.1{\$} and {\$}0.2{\$}. The {\$}Pr{\$} dependence of the heat transport enhancement can be understood in its relation to the coverage area of the thermal plumes over the thermal boundary layer (BL) where larger coverage is observed for larger {\$}Pr{\$} due to a smaller thermal diffusivity. We further show that {\$}\backslashGamma{\_}{\{}opt{\}}{\$} is closely related to the crossing of thermal and momentum BLs, and find that {\$}Nu{\$} declines sharply when the thickness ratio of the thermal and momentum BLs exceeds a certain value of about one. In addition, through examining the temporally averaged flow fields and 2D mode decomposition, it is found that for smaller {\$}Pr{\$} the large-scale circulation is robust against the geometrical confinement of the convection cell.},

abstract = {A critical ingredient of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is vertical mixing, which causes dense waters in the deep sea to rise throughout the stratified interior to the upper ocean. Here, we report a laboratory study aimed at understanding the contributions from surface thermal forcing (STF) to this mixing process. Our study reveals that the ratio of the thermocline thickness to the fluid depth largely determines the mixing rate and the mixing efficiency in an overturning flow driven by STF. By applying this finding to a hypothetical MOC driven purely by STF, we obtain a mixing rate of O(1026m2=s) and a corresponding meridional heat flux of O(1022 petawatt, PW), which are far smaller than the values found for real oceans. These results provide quantitative support for the notion that STF alone is not sufficient to drive the MOC, which essentially acts as a heat conveyor belt powered by other energy sources.},

It is found that, when the groove height is smaller than the boundary layer thickness, the torque is the same as that of the smooth wall cases. With increasing {\$}Ta{\$} , the boundary layer thickness becomes smaller than the groove height. Plumes are ejected from the tips of the grooves and secondary circulations between the latter are formed. This is associated with a sharp increase of the torque, and thus the effective scaling law for the torque versus {\$}Ta{\$} becomes much steeper. Further increasing {\$}Ta{\$} does not result in an additional slope increase. Instead, the effective scaling law saturates to the ‘ultimate' regime effective exponents seen for smooth walls. It is found that even though after saturation the slope is the same as for the smooth wall case, the absolute value of torque is increased, and more so with the larger size of the grooves.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) Turbulence governs the transport of heat, mass and momentum on multiple scales. In real-world applications, wall-bounded turbulence typically involves surfaces that are rough; however, characterizing and understanding the effects of wall roughness on turbulence remains a challenge. Here, by combining extensive experiments and numerical simulations, we examine the paradigmatic Taylor–Couette system, which describes the closed flow between two independently rotating coaxial cylinders. We show how wall roughness greatly enhances the overall transport properties and the corresponding scaling exponents associated with wall-bounded turbulence. We reveal that if only one of the walls is rough, the bulk velocity is slaved to the rough side, due to the much stronger coupling to that wall by the detaching flow structures. If both walls are rough, the viscosity dependence is eliminated, giving rise to asymptotic ultimate turbulence—the upper limit of transport—the existence of which was predicted more than 50 years ago. In this limit, the scaling laws can be extrapolated to arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers.},

abstract = {In thermal convection, roughness is often used as a means to enhance heat transport, expressed in Nusselt number. Yet there is no consensus on whether the Nusselt vs. Rayleigh number scaling exponent ({\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Nu{\}} \backslashsim \backslashmathrm{\{}Ra{\}}{\^{}}\backslashbeta{\$}) increases or remains unchanged. Here we numerically investigate turbulent Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'enard convection over rough plates in two dimensions, up to {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Ra{\}}=10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}. Varying the height and wavelength of the roughness elements with over 200 combinations, we reveal the existence of two universal regimes. In the first regime, the local effective scaling exponent can reach up to 1/2. However, this cannot be explained as the attainment of the so-called ultimate regime as suggested in previous studies, because a further increase in {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}Ra{\}}{\$} leads to the second regime, in which the scaling saturates back to a value close to the smooth case. Counterintuitively, the transition from the first to the second regime corresponds to the competition between bulk and boundary layer flow: from the bulk-dominated regime back to the classical boundary-layer-controlled regime. Our study clearly demonstrates that the local {\$}1/2{\$} scaling does not signal the onset of asymptotic ultimate thermal convection.},

abstract = {Statistical properties of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection at low Prandtl numbers (Pr), which are typical for liquid metals such as mercury, gallium or liquid sodium, are investigated in high-resolution three-dimensional spectral element simulations in a closed cylindrical cell with an aspect ratio of one and are compared to previous turbulent convection simulations in air. We compare the scaling of global momentum and heat transfer. The scaling exponents are found to be in agreement with experiments. Mean profiles of the root-mean-square velocity as well as the thermal and kinetic energy dissipation rates have growing amplitudes with decreasing Prandtl number which underlies a more vigorous bulk turbulence in the low-Pr regime. The skin-friction coefficient displays a Reynolds-number dependence that is close to that of an isothermal, intermittently turbulent velocity boundary layer. The thermal boundary layer thicknesses are larger as Pr decreases and conversely the velocity boundary layer thicknesses become smaller. We investigate the scaling exponents and find a slight decrease in exponent magnitude for the thermal boundary layer thickness as Pr decreases, but find the opposite case for the velocity boundary layer thickness scaling. A growing area fraction of turbulent patches close to the heating and cooling plates can be detected by exceeding a locally defined shear Reynolds number threshold. This area fraction is larger for lower Pr at the same Ra. Our analysis of the kurtosis of the locally defined shear Reynolds number demonstrates that the intermittency in the boundary layer is significantly increased for the lower Prandtl number and for sufficiently high Rayleigh number compared to convection in air. This complements our previous findings of enhanced bulk intermittency in low-Prandtl-number convection.},

For decades, Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection has been a paradigm for the study of convective heat transport, and how to improve its overall heat-transfer efficiency is still an open question. Here, we report an experimental and numerical study that reveals a novel mechanism that leads to much enhanced heat transport. When vertical partitions are inserted into a convection cell with thin gaps left open between the partition walls and the cooling/heating plates, it is found that the convective flow becomes self-organized and more coherent, leading to an unprecedented heat-transport enhancement. In particular, our experiments show that with six partition walls inserted, the heat flux can be increased by approximately 30 {\%}. Numerical simulations show a remarkable heat-flux enhancement of up to 2.3 times (with 28 partition walls) that without any partitions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The experiments were conducted with cylindrical convection cells of unity aspect ratio and over the range of the Rayleigh number from 1 x 10(9) to 1 x 10(10). The azimuthal angle of the circulation plane of the mean wind was measured using both the particle image velocimetry and flow-visualization techniques. It is found that the azimuthal motion consists of erratic fluctuations and a time-periodic oscillation. The orientation of the wind is found to be "locked," i.e., it fluctuates about a preferred direction most of the time with all other orientations appearing as "transient states," and large excursions of the azimuthal angle often result in a net rotation which takes the wind back to the preferred orientation. The rate of erratic rotation of the circulation plane is found to have a strong dependence on Ra. Our result suggests that the oscillatory motion of the wind in its vertically oriented circulation plane and the orientational oscillation of the circulation plane itself have the same dynamic origin.},

Shadowgraph and particle image velocimetry techniques are used to visualize the motion of thermal plumes and measure the velocity of the plumes and of the 'background' flow field, as the fluid motion evolves from quiescent to steady state. The experiment reveals the dynamical origin of the initial horizontal motion required by the large-scale flow: the fluid entrainment caused by the plume's vertical motion generates vortices surrounding the plume itself. These vortices in turn generate the initial horizontal motion of the flow field. Two types of interactions have been identified: (i) direct plume-vortex interaction; and (ii) plume-plume interaction via vortices. These interactions and the interaction and merging of the vortices from neighbouring plumes lead to groupings and/or merging of plumes, which in turn generate vortices of even larger scale. As a result of these interactions, the convective flow evolves into a coherent rotatory motion consisting of mainly the plumes themselves and spanning the whole convection box. This study clearly demonstrates that it is the thermal plumes that initiate the horizontal large-scale flow across the top and bottom conducting plates. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

This contrasts sharply to the finding in Gamma=1 geometry and implies that cessations in the two geometries are governed by different dynamics. It is found that the occurrence of reversals is a Poisson process and that a stronger rebound of the flow strength after a reversal or cessation leads to a longer period of stability of the LSC. Several properties of reversals and cessations in this system are found to be statistically similar to those of geomagnetic reversals. A direct measurement of the velocity field reveals that a cessation corresponds to a momentary decoherence of the LSC.},

abstract = {We present an experimental investigation of the dynamics and flow-coupling of convective turbulent flows in a cylindrical Rayleigh-Benard convection cell with two immiscible fluids, water and fluorinert FC-77 electronic liquid (FC77). It is found that one large-scale circulation (LSC) roll exists in each of the fluid layers, and that their circulation planes have two preferred azimuthal orientations separated by {\$}\backslashsim\backslashpi{\$}. A surprising finding of the study is that cessations/reversals of the LSC in FC77 of the two-layer system occur much more frequently than they do in single-layer turbulent RBC, and that a cessation is most likely to result in a flow reversal of the LSC, which is in sharp contrast with the uniform distribution of the orientational angular change of the LSC before and after cessations in single-layer turbulent RBC. This implies that the dynamics governing cessations and reversals in the two systems are very different. Two coupling modes, thermal coupling (flow directions of the two LSCs are opposite to each other at the fluid-fluid interface) and viscous coupling (flow directions of the two LSCs are the same at the fluid-fluid interface), are identified with the former one as the predominant mode. That most cessations (in the FC77 layer) end up as reversals can be understood as a symmetry breaking imposed by the orientation of the LSC in the water layer, which remained unchanged most of the time. Furthermore, the frequently occurring cessations and reversals are caused by the system switching between its two metastable states, i.e. thermal and viscous coupling modes. It is also observed that the strength of the LSC in water becomes weaker when the LSC in FC77 rotates faster azimuthally and that the flow strength in FC77 becomes stronger when the LSC in water rotates faster azimuthally, i.e. the influence of the LSC in one fluid layer on the other is not symmetric.},

The dynamics of the LSC is measured using the multithermal probe technique. Both the sinusoidal-fitting (SF) and the temperature-extrema-extraction (TEE) methods are used to analyse the properties of the LSC. It is found that the LSC in high-Pr regime remains a single-roll structure. The azimuthal motion of the LSC is a diffusive process, which is the same as those for Pr around 1. However, the azimuthal diffusion of the LSC, characterized by the angular speed Ω is almost two orders of magnitude smaller when compared with that in water. The non-dimensional time-averaged amplitude of the angular speed ?|Ω|?Td (Td = L2/$\kappa$ is the thermal diffusion time) of the LSC at the mid-height of the convection cell increases with Ra as a power law, which is ?|Ω|?Td ∝ Ra0.36±0.01. The Re number based on the oscillation frequency of the LSC is found to scale with Ra as Re = 0.13Ra0.43±0.01. It is also found that the normalized flow strength ?$\delta$?/?T × Ra/Pr ∝ Re1.5±0.1, with the exponent in good agreement with that predicted by Brown {\&} Ahlers (Phys.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}We present experimental evidence that a minute amount of polymer additives can significantly enhance heat transport in the bulk region of turbulent thermal convection. The effects of polymer additives are found to be the enhancement of coherent heat fluxes and suppression of incoherent heat fluxes. The enhanced heat transport is associated with the increased coherency of thermal plumes, as a result of the suppression of small-scale turbulent fluctuations by polymers. The incoherent heat flux, arising from turbulent background fluctuations, makes no net contribution to heat transport. The fact that polymer additives can increase the coherency of thermal plumes is supported by the measurements of a number of local quantities, such as the extracted plume amplitude and width, the velocity autocorrelation functions and the velocity–temperature cross-correlation coefficient. The results from local measurements also suggest the existence of a threshold value for the polymer concentration, only above which significant modification of the plume coherent properties and enhancement of the local heat flux can be observed. Estimation of the plume emission rate suggests a stabilization of the thermal boundary layer by polymer additives.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The study provides a direct confirmation that a rotatory mean wind indeed persists for the highest value of Ra reached in the experiment. The measurement reveals that the mean flow in the central region of the convection cell is of the shape of a coherent elliptical rotating core for Ra below 1?1010. Above this Ra, the orientation of the elliptical core changes by a 90° angle and an inner core rotating at a lower rate inside the original bulk core emerges. It is further found that the rotation frequencies of the inner core and the outer shell have distinct scalings with Ra; the scaling exponent for the outer-shell is 0.5 and it is 0.4 for the inner core. From the measured rms and skewness distributions of the velocity field, we find that velocity fluctuations at the cell center are neither homogenous nor isotropic. The turbulent energy production fields further reveal that the mean wind is not driven by turbulent fluctuations associated with Reynolds stress.},

abstract = {This paper reports particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement,, characterizing turbulent flow in a channel with superhydrophobic surfaces, structured and wetting surfaces, and smooth bottom surfaces. The superhydrophobic and structured surfaces are fabricated with alternating ribs and cavities. Both longitudinal and transverse rib/cavity orientations were considered and the surfaces were made superhydrophobic by application of a Teflon coating. The widths of the ribs and cavities were 8 and 32 mu m, respectively, and the depth of the cavities was 15 mu m. PIV measurements were acquired for all surfaces considered over the Reynolds numbers range from 4800 to 10 000. Results from the smooth bottom wall measurements were used as a basis for comparison. The hydraulic diameter of the channel was nominally 8.2 mm with an aspect ratio of 8.9. The PIV data captured aggregate velocities over multiple rib/cavity modules, such that a spanwise-averaged (over the width of the laser beam) velocity profile was obtained at the channel centerline. The time-averaged velocity profiles reveal no discernible time-mean slip velocity at the superhydrophobic wall. However, the different surfaces are shown to exhibit a systematic influence on the turbulence intensities, total and turbulent shear stress distributions, turbulence production in the channel, and local friction factors. Superhydrophobic surfaces with the ribs and cavities aligned with the flow are shown to yield an 11{\%} decrease in the friction factor while the same surfaces aligned in the transverse direction are shown to cause a modest increase in the friction factor.

Both the local concentration of fluorescence dye and the local temperature are measured near the sidewall of a rectangular cell. It is found that, although they are advected by the same turbulent flow, the two scalars distribute differently. This difference is twofold, i.e., both the quantities themselves and their small-scale increments have different distributions. Our results show that there is a certain buoyant scale based on time domain, i.e., the Bolgiano time scale t{\_}{\{}B{\}} , above which buoyancy effects are significant. Above t{\_}{\{}B{\}} , temperature is active and is found to be more intermittent than concentration, which is passive. This suggests that the active scalar possesses a higher level of intermittency in turbulent thermal convection. It is further found that the mixing of both scalar fields are isotropic for scales larger than t{\_}{\{}B{\}} even though buoyancy acts on the fluid in the vertical direction. Below t{\_}{\{}B{\}} , temperature is passive and is found to be more anisotropic than concentration. But this higher degree of anisotropy is attributed to the higher diffusivity of temperature over that of concentration. From the simultaneous measurements of temperature and concentration, it is shown that two scalars have similar autocorrelation functions and there is a strong and positive correlation between them.},

The distribution of $\Gamma$r is found to depend on the scale r, reflecting strong intermittency.

The experiments were performed in three water-filled cylindrical convection cells with aspect ratios 2, 1 and 0.5 and over the Rayleigh number range 5 x 10(7) {\textless}= Ra {\textless}= 10(11). TLC thermal images of horizontal plane cuts at various depths below the top plate were acquired. Three-dimensional (3D) images of thermal plumes were then reconstructed from the 2D slices of the temperature field. The results show that the often-called sheetlike plumes are really 1D structures and may be called rodlike plumes. We find that the number densities for both sheetlike/rodlike and mushroomlike plumes have power-law dependence on Ra with scaling exponents of similar to 0.3, which is close to that between the Nusselt number Nu and Ra. This result suggests that it is the plume number that primarily determines the scaling exponent of the Nu-Ra scaling relation. The evolution of the aspect ratio of sheetlike/rodlike plumes reveals that, as Ra increases, the plume geometry changes from more-elongated to less-elongated. Our study of the plume area fraction (fraction of coverage over the surface of the plate) further reveals that the increase in plume numbers with Ra mainly comes from an increase in plume emission, rather than fragmentation of plumes. In addition, the area, perimeter and shape complexity of the 2D horizontal cuts of sheetlike/rodlike plumes were studied and all are found to obey log-normal distributions.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} The double diffusive convection between two parallel plates is numerically studied for a series of parameters. The flow is driven by the salinity difference and stabilised by the thermal field. Our simulations are directly compared with experiments by Hage {\&}amp; Tilgner ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Phys. Fluids{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} , vol. 22, 2010, 076603) for several sets of parameters and reasonable agreement is found. This, in particular, holds for the salinity flux and its dependence on the salinity Rayleigh number. Salt fingers are present in all simulations and extend through the entire height. The thermal Rayleigh number seems to have a minor influence on the salinity flux but affects the Reynolds number and the morphology of the flow. In addition to the numerical calculation, we apply the Grossmann–Lohse theory for Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard flow to the present problem without introducing any new coefficients. The theory successfully predicts the salinity flux both with respect to the scaling and even with respect to the absolute value for the numerical and experimental results. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Direct numerical simulations are conducted for double diffusive convection (DDC) bounded by two parallel plates. The Prandtl numbers, i.e. the ratios between the viscosity and the molecular diffusivities of scalars, are similar to the values of seawater. The DDC flow is driven by an unstable salinity difference (here across the two plates) and stabilized at the same time by a temperature difference.

abstract = {An experimental study of the morphological evolution of thermal plumes in turbulent thermal convection is presented. Individual sheetlike plumes are extracted and their area, circumference, and "heat content" are found to all exhibit log-normal distributions. As the sheetlike plumes move across the plate they collide and convolute into spiraling swirls. These swirls then spiral away from the plates to become mushroomlike plumes which are accompanied by strong vertical vorticity. The measured profiles of plume numbers and of vertical vorticity quantify the morphological transition of sheetlike plumes to mushroomlike ones and the mixing and merging or clustering of mushroomlike plumes. The fluctuating vorticity is found to have the same exponential distribution and scaling behavior as the fluctuating temperature.},

Unlike its weak effect in the system's global heat transport, the aspect ratio Gamma is found to play an important role in the dynamics of the azimuthal motion of the LSC. It is found that in larger Gamma geometries the azimuthal motion of the LSC's vertical plane is confined in smaller azimuthal region than that in smaller Gamma geometries. The twisting motion between top and bottom parts of the LSC observed in the Gamma=1 geometry is found to be absent in the Gamma=1/2 case. It is found that in the Gamma=1/2 geometry the orientational change mid R:Deltavarphimid R: through a reorientation has an exponential distribution, in contrast to the power-law distribution for the Gamma=1 case. Despite the difference in orientational change, the occurrence of the reorientations is a Poisson process in both geometries. Using the conditional average of the time interval between adjacent cessations or reversals on the rebound flow strength, we demonstrate the possibility to empirically predict when the next cessation or reversal will most likely occur if the rebound flow strength of the preceding cessation or reversal is given.},

It is found that both a single circulating roll flow structure and one with two vertically stacked counter-rotating rolls exist in the three aspect ratio cells. The average percentages of time that the large-scale mean flow spends in the single-roll mode ?SRM? and the double-roll mode ?DRM? are 87.1{\%} and 0.8{\%} for ?=1, 69.5{\%} and 7.9{\%} for ?=1/2, and 26.7{\%} and 34.1{\%} for ?=1/3. Several routes of transitions among the different flow modes are identified. In addition, different structures for the DRM are found and their relative weights are determined. We also show direct evidence that the SRM is more efficient for heat transfer than the DRM. Although the difference is very small, it shows how changes in internal flow state can manifest in the global transport properties of the system. It is also found that the time interval between successive flow mode transitions has an exponential distribution, suggesting a Poisson process for the underlying dynamics. The duration of the flow mode transition is found to be log-normally distributed.},

In addition, it is found that during the cessation (reversal) of the LSC, the second mode dominates, containing 51.3 {\%} (50.1 {\%}) of the total flow energy, which reveals that the commonly called cessation event is not the cessation of the entire flow but only the cessation of the first mode (LSC). The experiment reveals that the second mode and the remaining higher-order modes play important roles in the dynamical process of the reversal/cessation of the LSC.

At Rayleigh number Ra=8.9x10(11) and Prandtl number Pr=4, temperature oscillations can be observed in most parts of the system and the oscillation period remains almost constant, tT=74+/-2 s. Velocity oscillation can only be found in its horizontal component vy (perpendicular to the large-scale circulation plane) near the cell sidewall, its oscillation period is also constant, tv=65+/-2 s, at these positions. Temperature and velocity oscillations have different Ra dependences, which are, respectively, indicated by the P{\'{e}}clect number PeT=0.55Ra0.47 and Pev=0.28Ra0.50.

abstract = {We report high-precision measurements of the Nusselt number Nu as a function of the Rayleigh number Ra in water-filled rectangular Rayleigh–B´ enard convection cells. The horizontal length L and width W of the cells are 50.0 and 15.0 cm, respectively, and the heights H = 49.9, 25.0, 12.5, 6.9, 3.5, and 2.4 cm, corresponding to the aspect ratios ($\Gamma$x ≡L/H,$\Gamma$y ≡W/H)=(1, 0.3), (2, 0.6), (4, 1.2), (7.3, 2.2), (14.3, 4.3), and (20.8, 6.3). The measurements were carried out over the Rayleigh number range 6×105 ?Ra?1011 and the Prandtl number range 5.2?Pr ?7. Our results show that for rectangular geometry turbulent heat transport is independent of the cells' aspect ratios and hence is insensitive to the nature and structures of the large-scale mean flows of the system. This is slightly different from the observations in cylindrical cells where Nu is found to be in general a decreasing function of $\Gamma$ , at least for $\Gamma$ = 1 and larger. Such a difference is probably a manifestation of the finite plate conductivity effect. Corrections for the influence of the finite conductivity of the top and bottom plates are made to obtain the estimates of Nu∞ for plates with perfect conductivity. The local scaling exponents $\beta$l of Nu∞ ∼ Ra$\beta$l are calculated and found to increase from 0.243 at Ra?9×105 to 0.327 at Ra?4×1010.},

abstract = {We investigate the structures of the near-plate velocity and temperature profiles at different horizontal positions along the conducting bottom (and top) plate of a Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection cell, using two-dimensional (2D) numerical data obtained at the Rayleigh number Ra = 10 8 and the Prandtl number Pr = 4.4 of an Oberbeck-Boussinesq flow with constant material parameters. The results show that most of the time, and for both velocity and temperature, the instantaneous profiles scaled by the dynamical frame method [Q. Zhou and K.-Q. Xia, "Measured instantaneous viscous boundary layer in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection," Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 104301 (2010)] agree well with the classical Prandtl-Blasius laminar boundary layer (BL) profiles. Therefore, when averaging in the dynamical reference frames, which fluctuate with the respective instantaneous kinematic and thermal BL thicknesses, the obtained mean velocity and temperature profiles are also of Prandtl-Blasius type for nearly all horizontal positions. We further show that in certain situations the traditional definitions based on the time-averaged profiles can lead to unphysical BL thicknesses, while the dynamical method also in such cases can provide a well-defined BL thickness for both the kinematic and the thermal BLs. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We report high-spatial-resolution measurements of the thermal boundary layer (BL) properties in turbulent thermal convection. The experiment was made near the lower conducting plate of a water-filled rectangular convection cell of height 0.76 m, with a Prandtl number Pr =4.3 and over the Rayleigh-number range 2×1010 {\textless}Ra{\textless}7×1011. Time series of the local temperature at various vertical distance z from the plate were measured. Statistical properties of the profiles of the temperature, i.e. the mean temperature ?T?, fluctuating temperature root mean square (r.m.s.) $\sigma$T, temperature skewness ST, and flatness FT, and those of the temperature time derivative, i.e. the r.m.s. $\sigma$?T, skewness S?T and flatness F?T of the derivative, are studied. It is found that most of these quantities exhibit some degree of invariability with Ra, especially for the regime inside the thermal BL. When comparing with the mean temperature profiles, the profiles of the second moment of temperature seem to possess a higher level of universality. It is shown that the distance $\delta$$\sigma$ from the plate to the maximal temperature r.m.s. position provides a natural length scale for the characterization of the thermal BL, as the statistical properties of the temperature field, such as its r.m.s., skewness and flatness, are all sharply different below and above this length scale, i.e. below $\delta$$\sigma$ , $\sigma$T increases linearly with the vertical distance z from the plate and ST is close to zero and FT is close to three and both quantities remains nearly constant, whereas above $\delta$$\sigma$ the decay of $\sigma$T obeys a logarithmic behaviour and ST and FT both exhibit a hill-like structure. It is also found that near the plate ?T?, $\sigma$T and $\sigma$?T all increase linearly with z. Our observations further reveal that such linear dependence occurs within a self-similar region of the thermal BL, where the temperature probability density functions can be scaled onto a single distribution that differs slightly from the Gaussian distribution. The Ra-dependencies of various thermal BL properties are also studied and our results yield $\delta$th/H = (6.85 ± 0.70)Ra−0.33±0.03, $\delta$$\sigma$/H = (2.86 ± 0.30)Ra−0.31±0.03 and $\delta$?$\sigma$/H = (25 ± 3)Ra−0.38±0.05, where H is the height of the cell, $\delta$th and $\delta$?$\sigma$ are the BL thicknesses determined respectively from the profiles of ?T? and $\sigma$?T.},

The first one is that, for the same flow, the probability density functions (PDFs) of eta are insensitive to turbulent intensity and large-scale inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the system. The second is that the small-scale dissipation dynamics in buoyancy-driven turbulence can be described by the same models developed for homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. However, the exact functional form of the PDF of the local dissipation scale is not universal with respect to different types of flows, but depends on the integral-scale velocity boundary condition, which is found to have an exponential, rather than Gaussian, distribution in turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection.},

For small values, $\delta$v(t) obeys a lognormal distribution, whereas for large values, the distribution of $\delta$v(t) exhibits an exponential tail. The variation of $\delta$v(t) with time is found to be driven by the fluctuations of the large-scale mean-flow velocity, and the local horizontal velocities close to the plate can be used as an instant measure of this variation.

It is found that in the RB system the cliff structures in the velocity field are generated by thermal plumes. These cliff structures induce asymmetry in the velocity increments, which leads us to consider the plus and minus velocity structure functions (VSF). The plus velocity increments exclude cliff structures, while the minus ones include them. Our results show that the scaling exponents of the plus VSFs are in excellent agreement with those predicted for homogeneous and isotropic turbulence (HIT), whereas those of the minus VSFs exhibit significant deviations from HIT expectations in places where thermal plumes abound. These results demonstrate that plus and minus VSFs can be used to quantitatively study the effect of cliff structures in the velocity field and to effectively disentangle the associated anisotropies caused by these structures.},

E{\}} $\backslash$textbf{\{}73{\}}, 055303(R) (2006)] is valid for the present velocity field for all over the cell, i.e., the isocorrelation contours of the measured {\$}C(r,\backslashtau){\$} have a shape of elliptical curves and hence {\$}C(r,\backslashtau){\$} can be related to {\$}C(r{\_}E,0){\$} via {\$}r{\_}E{\^{}}2=(r-\backslashbeta\backslashtau){\^{}}2+\backslashgamma{\^{}}2\backslashtau{\^{}}2{\$} with {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} being two characteristic velocities. We further show that the fitted {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} is proportional to the mean velocity of the flow, but the values of {\$}\backslashgamma{\$} are larger than the theoretical predictions. Specifically, we focus on two representative regions in the cell: the region near the cell sidewall and the cell's central region.

abstract = {Results from direct numerical simulation (DNS) for three-dimensional RayleighBnard convection in a cylindrical cell of aspect ratio 1/2 and Prandtl number Pr=0.7 are presented. They span five decades of Rayleigh number Ra from 2 106 to 2 × 1011. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data of Niemela et al. (Nature, vol. 404, 2000, p. 837). Previous DNS results from Amati et al. (Phys. Fluids, vol. 17, 2005, paper no. 121701) showed a heat transfer that was up to 30{\%} higher than the experimental values. The simulations presented in this paper are performed with a much higher resolution to properly resolve the plume dynamics. We find that in under-resolved simulations the hot (cold) plumes travel further from the bottom (top) plate than in the better-resolved ones, because of insufficient thermal dissipation mainly close to the sidewall (where the grid cells are largest), and therefore the Nusselt number in under-resolved simulations is overestimated. Furthermore, we compare the best resolved thermal boundary layer profile with the PrandtlBlasius profile. We find that the boundary layer profile is closer to the PrandtlBlasius profile at the cylinder axis than close to the sidewall, because of rising plumes close to the sidewall. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Numerical data for the heat transfer as a function of the Prandtl (Pr) and Rossby (Ro) numbers in turbulent rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection are presented for Rayleigh number Ra = 10 8. When Ro is fixed the heat transfer enhancement with respect to the non-rotating value shows a maximum as function of Pr. This maximum is due to the reduced efficiency of Ekman pumping when Pr becomes too small or too large. When Pr becomes small, i.e. for large thermal diffusivity, the heat that is carried by the vertical vortices spreads out in the middle of the cell, and Ekman pumping thus becomes less efficient. For higher Pr the thermal boundary layers (BLs) are thinner than the kinetic BLs and therefore the Ekman vortices do not reach the thermal BL. This means that the fluid that is sucked into the vertical vortices is colder than for lower Pr which limits the efficiency of the upwards heat transfer.},

abstract = {A systematic study of the effects of cell geometry on the dynamics of large-scale flows in turbulent thermal convection is carried out in horizontal cylindrical cells of different lengths filled with water. Four different flow modes are identified with increasing aspect ratio $\Gamma$ . For small aspect ratios ($\Gamma$ 0.16), the flow is highly confined in a thin disc-like cell with a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) large-scale circulation (LSC) in the circular plane of the cell. For larger aspect ratios ($\Gamma$ {\textgreater} 0.16), we observe periodic switching of the angular orientation $\theta$ of the rotation plane of LSC between the two longest diagonals of the cell. The sides of the container along which the LSC oscillates changes at a critical aspect ratio $\Gamma$ c 0.82. The measured switching period is equal to the LSC turnover time for $\Gamma$ $\Gamma$ c , shows a sharp increase at $\Gamma$ c and decays exponentially to the LSC turnover time with increasing $\Gamma$ . For $\Gamma$ 1.3, a periodic rocking of LSC along the long axis of the cylinder is also observed. The measured probability density function P($\theta$) of the LSC orientation $\theta$ peaks at the two diagonal positions, and its shape is described by a phenomenological model proposed by Brown {\&} Ahlers (Phys. Fluids, vol. 20, 2008b, 075101; J. Fluid Mech., vol. 638, 2009, pp. 383–400). Using this model, we describe the dynamics of the LSC orientation $\theta$ by stochastic motion in a double-well potential. The potential is predicted from a model in which the sidewall shape produces an orientation-dependent pressure on the LSC. This model also captures key features of the four flow modes. The experiment reveals an interesting array of rich dynamics of LSC in the horizontal cylinders, which are very different from those observed in the upright cylindrical convection cells. The success of the model for both upright and horizontal cylinders suggests that it can be applied to different geometries.},

This paper examines the intensity, duration and frequency of positive sea surface temperature anomalies in the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans over the period 1950-2014 using an objective definition for marine heatwaves based on their probability of occurrence. Small-area anomalies occur more frequently than large-area anomalies, and this relationship can be characterized by a power-law distribution. The relative frequency of large- versus small-area anomalies, represented by the power-law slope parameter, is modulated by basin-scale modes of natural climate variability and anthropogenic warming. Findings suggest that the probability of marine heatwaves is a trade-off between size, intensity and duration, and that region specific variability modulates the statistical attributes of these events.},

The emissions of plumes and plume clusters are detected by an array of thermistors embedded in the top and bottom plates of a I in diameter convection cell. We found that the product STST' of the temperature skewness S-T and the skewness of the temperature time derivative S-T' from the embedded thermistors may be used as a measure of the intensity of plume emissions and that STST', exhibits a pattern that corresponds well to the orientation of the large-scale circulation in the convecting flow. This is despite the fact that the temperature distribution across the plates is highly uniform, as indicated by the mean temperature of the embedded thermistors. By comparing the spatial distributions Of STST', and of the RMS temperature sigma, we further find that the maximum temperature fluctuations take place in regions dominated by plume mixing instead of regions of plume emission. It is also found that temperature fluctuations inside the conducting plates have the same statistical and scaling properties as those in the cell centre.},

abstract = {We report high-resolution measurements of the properties of the velocity boundary layer in turbulent thermal convection using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique and measurements of the temperature profiles and the thermal boundary layer. Both velocity and temperature measurements were made near the lower conducting plate of a rectangular convection cell using water as the convecting fluid, with the Rayleigh number Ra varying from 109 to 1010 and the Prandtl number Pr fixed at 4.3. From the measured profiles of the horizontal velocity we obtain the viscous boundary layer thickness . It is found that follows the classical Blasius-like laminar boundary layer in the present range of Ra, and it scales with the Reynolds number Re as /H = 0.64Re0.03 (where H is the cell height). While the measured viscous shear stress and Reynolds shear stress show that the boundary layer is laminar for Ra {\textless} 2.0 T(z) are found to follow either a power law or a logarithmic behaviour. The power-law fitting may be slightly favoured and its exponent is found to depend on Ra and varies from 0.77, which is much larger than the classical value of w(z) exhibit a much smaller scaling range and are also consistent with either a power-law or a logarithmic behaviour. The Reynolds number dependence of several wall quantities is also measured directly. These are the wall shear stress w {\~{}} Re {\~{}} Re0.80, and the skin-friction coefficient cf {\~{}} Rew 5). Our overall conclusion is that a Blasius-type laminar boundary condition is a good approximation for the velocity boundary layer in turbulent thermal convection for the present range of Rayleigh number and Prandtl number.},

By measuring the two-dimensional (2D) velocity vector map in different vertical cross sections of the cell, we investigate the 3D structures and dynamics of turbulent thermal convection. The experiment reveals how thermal plumes synchronize their emissions and organize their motions spatially between the top and bottom plates, leading to an oscillatory motion in the bulk region of the fluid with a period equal to twice the plume's cell-crossing time. From the measured instantaneous velocity vector map, we find the phase relationship between the velocity components along different directions and at different positions in a 2D plane. These phase relations illustrate how the convecting fluid in different regions of the cell interact with each other and generate a synchronized and coherent motion in a closed system.},

The apparently stochastic azimuthal motion of the flow structure, which generates a net rotation on average, is found to possess the characters of a Brownian ratchet. Using an artificially generated flow mode, we are able to produce a bimodal-Nu behavior and thus demonstrate that different flow states can indeed produce different global heat transport in a turbulent convection system.},

abstract = {A riddle in turbulent thermal convection is the apparent dispersion from 0.42 to 0.5 in the value of the scaling exponent of experimentally measured Reynolds number Re approximately Ragamma, where Ra is the Rayleigh number. The measured Re may be divided into two groups: one based on the circulation frequency of the mean wind and the other based on a directly measured velocity. With new experimental results we show that in frequency measurements the dispersion in gamma is a result of the evolution in the circulation path of the wind, and that in the velocity measurements it is caused by the inclusion of a counterflow in the mean velocity. When these factors are properly accounted for both groups give gamma=0.5, which may imply that a single mechanism is driving the flow for both low and high values of Ra.},

For this large NOBness the center temperature Tc is more than 5 K larger than the arithmetic mean temperature Tm between top and bottom plate and only weakly depends on Ra. To physically account for the NOB deviations of the Nusselt numbers from its Oberbeck-Boussinesq values, we apply the decomposition of NuNOB/NuOB into the product of two effects, namely first the change in the sum of the top and bottom thermal BL thicknesses, and second the shift of the center temperature Tc as compared to Tm. While for water the origin of the Nu deviation is totally dominated by the second effect (cf. Ahlers et al., J. Fluid Mech. 569, pp. 409 (2006)) for glycerol the first effect is dominating, in spite of the large increase of Tc as compared to Tm.},

For medium Prandtl number there is a diagonal large-scale convection roll and two smaller secondary rolls in the two remaining corners diagonally opposing each other. These corner-flow rolls play a crucial role for the large-scale wind reversal: They grow in kinetic energy and thus also in size thanks to plume detachments from the boundary layers up to the time that they take over the main, large-scale diagonal flow, thus leading to reversal. The Rayleigh vs Prandtl number space is mapped out. The occurrence of reversals sensitively depends on these parameters.},

abstract = {Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects on the now organization in two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard turbulence are numerically analysed. The working fluid is water. We focus on the temperature profiles, the centre temperature, the Nusselt number and on the analysis of the velocity field. Several velocity amplitudes (or Reynolds numbers) and several kinetic profiles are introduced and studied; these together describe the various features of the rather complex flow organization. The results are presented both as functions of the Rayleigh number Ra (with Ra up to 10(8)) for fixed temperature difference Delta between top and bottom plates and as functions of Delta ('non-Oberbeck-Boussinesqness') for fixed Ra with Delta up to 60 K. All results are consistent with the available experimental NOB data for the centre temperature T-c and the Nusselt number ratio Nu(NOB)/Nu(OB) (the label OB meaning that the Oberbeck-Boussitiesq conditions are valid). For the temperature profiles we find due to plume emission from the boundary layers - increasing deviations from the extended Prandtl-Blasius boundary layer theory presented in Ahlers et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 569, 2006, p. 409) with increasing Ra, while the centre temperature itself is surprisingly well predicted by that theory. For given non-Oberbeck-Boussinesqness Delta, both the centre temperature T-c and the Nusselt number ratio Nu(NOB)/Nu(OB) only weakly depend oil Ra in the Ra range considered here.Beyond Ra approximate to 10(6) the flow consists of a large diagonal centre convection roll and two smaller rolls in the upper and lower corners, respectively ('corner flows'). Also in the NOB case the centre convection roll is still characterized by only one velocity scale. In contrast, the top and bottom corner flows are then of different strengths, the bottom one being a factor 1.3 faster (for Delta = 40 K) than the top one, due to the lower viscosity in the hotter bottom boundary layer. Under NOB conditions the enhanced lower corner flow as well as the enhanced centre roll lead to an enhancement of the volume averaged energy based Reynolds number Re-E = (1/2u(2))(1/2) L/v of about 4{\%} to 5{\%} for Delta=60 K. Moreover, we find Re-NOB(E)/Re-OB(E) approximate to (beta(T-c)/beta(T-m))(1/2), with beta the thermal expansion coefficient and T the arithmetic mean temperature between top and bottom plate temperatures. This corresponds to the ratio of the free fall velocities at the respective temperatures. By artificially switching off the temperature dependence of beta in the numerics, the NOB modifications of Re-E is less than 1 {\%} even at Delta = 60 K, revealing the temperature dependence of the thermal expansion coefficient as the main origin of the NOB effects on the global Reynolds number in water.},

The dynamical frame method shows that the measured temperature profiles in the spatially and temporally local frame are much closer to the temperature profile of a laminar, zero-pressure gradient boundary layer (BL) according to Pohlhausen than in the fixed reference frame. The deviation between the measured profiles in the dynamical reference frame and the laminar profiles increases with decreasing Pr, where the thermal BL is more exposed to the bulk fluctuations due to the thinner kinetic BL, and increasing Ra, where more plumes are passing the measurement location.},

Here we pick four well-established (and sufficiently distant) $\backslash${\$}\backslashmathit{\{}Nu{\}}(\backslashmathit{\{}Ra{\}}, \backslashmathit{\{}Pr{\}})\backslash{\$} data points and show that the resulting $\backslash${\$}\backslashmathit{\{}Nu{\}}(\backslashmathit{\{}Ra{\}}, \backslashmathit{\{}Pr{\}})\backslash{\$} function is in agreement with almost all established experimental and numerical data up to the ultimate regime of thermal convection, whose onset also follows from the theory.

abstract = {We report on a numerical study of the aspect-ratio dependency of Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection, using direct numerical simulations. The investigated domains have equal height and width while the aspect ratio $\Gamma$ of depth per height is varied between 1/10 and 1. The Rayleigh numbers Ra for this study variate between 105 and 109, while the Prandtl number is Pr = 0.786 . The main focus of the study concerns the dependency of the Nusselt number Nu and the Reynolds number Re on Ra and $\Gamma$. It turns out that due to $\Gamma$, differences to the cubic case (i.e., $\Gamma$ = 1) in Nu of up to 55{\%} and in Re of up to 97{\%} occur, which decrease for increasing Ra . In particular for small $\Gamma$ sudden drops in the Ra -scaling of Nu and Re appear for Ra ≈ 10 6 . Further analysis reveals that these correspond to the onset of unsteady motion accompanied by changes in the global flow structure. The latter is investigated by statistical analysis of the heat flux distribution on the bottom and top plates and a decomposition of the instantaneous flow fields into two-dimensional modes. For Ra slightly above the onset of unsteady motion (i.e., Ra ≈ 10 6 ) for all considered $\Gamma$ ⩽ 1/3 a four-roll structure is present, which corresponds to thermal plumes moving vertically through the domain{\&}apos;s center. For Ra ≥ 10 7 , also for small $\Gamma$, a single-roll structure is dominant, in agreement with two-dimensional simulations and experiments at larger Ra and Pr .},

The analysis is then reduced to two dimensions by considering only the plane of the LSC. Within this plane the LSC is treated as a wind with thermal and viscous boundary layers developing close to the horizontal plates. Special focus is on the spatial development of the wind magnitude and the boundary layer thicknesses along the bottom plate. A method for the local analysis of the instantaneous boundary layer thicknesses is introduced which shows a dramatically changing wind magnitude along the wind path. Furthermore a linear increase of the viscous and thermal boundary layer thickness along the wind direction is observed for all Ra considered while their ratio is spatially constant but depends weakly on Ra. A possible explanation is a strong spatial variation of the wind magnitude and fluctuations in the boundary layer region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Turbulent Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection in cubic cells is studied experimentally using two similar but not identical experimental setups in different laboratories. Both teams have made experiments for the same set of Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers (Pr = 3.5, Pr = 6.1, Ra=2.0{\textperiodcentered}109, Ra=6.0{\textperiodcentered}109, Ra=1.6{\textperiodcentered}1010). Experiments showed that the structure of the mean flow and local characteristics of turbulent pulsations are robust and do not depend strongly on the technical details of experimental setup. Periodic low-frequency oscillations and orientations of large-scale circulation (LSC) are more sensitive to the experimental setup design. Long-time measurements using differential thermocouples revealed that preferential orientation of LSC is along of one of the diagonals, however it can deviate from exact diagonal orientation. Analyses of temperature and velocity measurements showed that dominant periodic oscillations of LSC can not be explained as simple modulation of the intensity of the large-scale diagonal flow because most intense oscillations are observed in the direction, which is orthogonal to the plane of LSC. Experimental data obtained independently by two teams can be used as a benchmark for CFD codes. Numerical simulation using a standard widely-spread CFD code was carried out. In general, on the base of overall comparison between experimental and large-eddy simulation results we concluded that for the described regimes LES gives satisfactory agreement with experiment reproducing the small-scale dynamics of the turbulent flow and the behavior of LSC.},

abstract = {The effects of the plates thermal properties on the heat transfer in turbulent thermal convection are investigated by direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation. It has been found that the governing parameter is the ratio of the thermal resistances of the fluid layer R-f and the plates R-p; when this ratio is smaller than a threshold value (R-f/R(p)approximate to300 arbitrarily defined by requiring that the actual heat transfer differs by less than 2{\%} from its ideal value), the finite conductivity of the plates limits the heat transfer in the cell. In addition, since R-f decreases for increasing Rayleigh numbers, any experimental apparatus is characterized by a threshold Rayleigh number that cannot be exceeded if the heat transfer in the cell has not to be influenced by the thermal properties of the plates. It has been also shown that the plate effects cannot be totally corrected by subtracting the temperature drop occurring within the plates from the measured total temperature difference. This is due to the changes produced in the thermal plume dynamics by the reduced local heat flux at the plate/fluid interface. A model with a correction factor has been derived to account for the plates effects and it gave the appropriate correction for a recent experiment in which the heat transfer measurements were systematically smaller than a theoretical prediction. In view of the present correction the discrepancy between theory and experiments addressed by Nikolaenko and Ahlers [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 084501 (2003)] can be therefore resolved. The application of the proposed correction to the results in the literature can also reconcile the heat transfer measurements for water and mercury that appear systematically smaller than in other fluids.

The numerical approach allows three-dimensional velocity, vorticity and temperature fields to be analysed. Furthermore, several numerical probes are placed within the fluid volume, permitting point-wise velocity and temperature time series to be extracted. Taking advantage of the data accessibility provided by the direct numerical simulation the flow dynamics has been explored and separated into its mean large-scale and fluctuating components, both in the bulk and in the boundary layer regions. The existence of large-scale structures creating a mean flow sweeping the horizontal walls has been confirmed. However, the presence of a single recirculation cell filling the whole volume was observed only for Ra {\textless} 10(9)-10(10) and with reduced intensity compared to axisymmetric toroidal vortices attached to the horizontal plates. At larger Ra the single cell is no longer observed, and the bulk recirculation breaks up into two counter-rotating asymmetric unity-aspect-ratio rolls. This transition has an appreciable impact on the boundary layer structure and on the global heat transfer properties. The large-scale structure signature is reflected in the statistics of the bulk turbulence as well, which, taking advantage of the large number of numerical probes available, is examined both in terms of frequency spectra and of temperature structure functions. The present results are also discussed within the framework of recent theoretical developments showing that the effect of the aspect ratio on the global heat transfer properties at large Ra still remains an open question.},

As the CFL condition is more restrictive at high driving, implicit time integration of the viscous terms in the wall-parallel directions is no longer required. This avoids the communication of non-local information to a process for the computation of implicit derivatives in these directions. We explain in detail the numerical scheme used for the integration of the equations, and the underlying parallelization. The code is shown to have very good strong and weak scaling to at least 64.

The profile is logarithmic only in these regions and not in the rest of the boundary layer where it is sheared by the large scale wind and impacted by plumes.

The findings reveal that the temperature profiles are strongly connected to thermal plume emission and support a perception that parts of the boundary layer can be turbulent, while others are not. The transition to the ultimate regime, in which the boundary layers are considered to be fully turbulent, can therefore be understood as a gradual increases in fraction of the plume-emitting ('turbulent') regions of the boundary layer.},

abstract = {The aspect ratio ($\Gamma$) dependence of the heat transfer (Nusselt number Nu in dimensionless form) in turbulent (two-dimensional) Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection is numerically studied in the regime 0.4≤$\Gamma$≤1.25 for Rayleigh numbers 10(7)≤Ra≤Ra(9) and Prandtl numbers Pr=0.7 (gas) and 4.3 (water). Nu($\Gamma$) shows a very rich structure with sudden jumps and sharp transitions. We connect these structures to the way the flow organizes itself in the sample and explain why the aspect ratio dependence of Nu is more pronounced for small Pr. Even for fixed $\Gamma$ different turbulent states (with different resulting Nu) can exist, between which the flow can or cannot switch. In the latter case the heat transfer thus depends on the initial conditions.},

First, we consider small aspect-ratio cells, where at high Ra number we find a sharp transition from a low Ra number branch towards a high Ra number branch, due to changes in the flow structure. Subsequently, we show that the influence of the aspect-ratio on the heat transport decreases with increasing aspect-ratio, although even at very large aspect-ratio of $\Gamma$ ≈ 10 variations up to 2.5{\%} in the heat transport as a function of $\Gamma$ are observed. Finally, we observe long-lived transients up to at least Ra = 109, as in certain aspect-ratio cells we observe different flow states that are stable for thousands of turnover times.},

abstract = {In turbulent thermal convection in cylindrical samples with an aspect ratio $\Gamma$≡D/L (D is the diameter and L the height), the Nusselt number Nu is enhanced when the sample is rotated about its vertical axis because of the formation of Ekman vortices that extract additional fluid out of thermal boundary layers at the top and bottom. We show from experiments and direct numerical simulations that the enhancement occurs only above a bifurcation point at a critical inverse Rossby number 1/Ro(c), with 1/Ro(c)∝1/$\Gamma$. We present a Ginzburg-Landau-like model that explains the existence of a bifurcation at finite 1/Ro(c) as a finite-size effect. The model yields the proportionality between 1/Ro(c) and 1/$\Gamma$ and is consistent with several other measured or computed system properties.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the properties of turbulent thermal convection of a fluid with a Prandtl number Pr = 4.38 in a cylindrical cell with an aspect ratio $\Gamma$ = 0.50. The rotational symmetry was broken by a small tilt of the sample axis relative to gravity. Measurements of the heat transport (as expressed by the Nusselt number Nu), as well as properties of the large-scale circulation (LSC) obtained from temperature measurements along the sidewall, are presented. In contradistinction to similar experiments using containers of aspect ratio $\Gamma$ = 1.00 (Ahlers et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 557, 2006b, pp. 347–367) and $\Gamma$ = 0.50 (Chill` a et al., Eur. Phys. J. B, vol. 40, 2004, pp. 223–227; Sun, Xi {\&} Xia, Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 95, 2005, p. 074502; Roche et al., New J. Phys., vol. 12, 2010, p. 085014), we see a very small increase of the heat transport for tilt angles up to about 0.1 rad. Based on measurements of properties of the LSC we explain this increase by a stabilization of the single-roll state (SRS) of the LSC and a destabilization of the double-roll state (DRS) (it is known from previous work that the SRS has a slightly larger heat transport than the DRS). Quantitative measurements of the strength and the orientation of the LSC show that its azimuthal diffusion is suppressed with increasing tilt whereas the torsional oscillation becomes more pronounced and its frequency increases.},

abstract = {We report measurements of logarithmic temperature profiles Theta(z, r) = A(r) x ln(z/L) + B(r) in the bulk of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection (here Theta is a scaled and time-averaged local temperature in the fluid, z is the vertical and r the radial position, and L is the sample height). Two samples had aspect ratios Gamma equivalent to D/L = 1.00 and 0.50 (where D = 190 mm is the diameter). The fluid was a fluorocarbon with a Prandtl number of Pr = 12.3. The measurements covered the Rayleigh-number range 2 x 10(10) less than or similar to Ra less than or similar to 2 x 10(11) for Gamma = 1.00 and 3 x 10(11) less than or similar to Ra less than or similar to 2 x 10(12) for Gamma = 0.50. In contradistinction to what had been found for Gamma = 0.50 and Pr = 0.78 by Ahlers et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 109, 2012, art. 114501; J. Fluid Mech., 2014, in press), the measurements revealed no Ra dependence of the amplitude A(r) of the logarithmic term. Within the experimental resolution, the amplitude was also found to be independent of Gamma. It varied with r in a manner consistent with the function A(xi) = A(1)/root 2 xi - xi(2), where xi equivalent to (R - r)/R with R = D/2 and A(1) similar or equal to 0.0016. The results for A(r) are smaller than those obtained from experiments and direct numerical simulations (Ahlers et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 109, 2012, art. 114501) at similar values of Ra for Pr = 0.7 and Gamma = 1/2 by a factor that depended slightly upon Ra but was close to 2.},

Contrary to this expectation, we found a sequence of such transitions in turbulent rotating Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection as the rotation rate was increased. This phenomenon was observed in cylindrical samples with aspect ratios (diameter/height) $\Gamma$ ¼ 1.00 and 0.50. It became most prominent at very large Rayleigh numbers up to 2 × 10 12 , where the fluctuations are extremely vigorous, and was manifested most clearly for $\Gamma$ ¼ 1.00. It was found in the heat transport as well as in the temperature gradient near the sample center. We conjecture that the transitions are between different large-scale structures which involve changes of symmetry and thus cannot be gradual [L.},

Two different sets of boundary conditions of temperature and total water content are compared: imposed constant amplitudes which translate into Dirichlet boundary conditions for the scalar field fluctuations about the quiescent diffusive equilibrium and constant imposed flux boundary conditions that result in Neumann boundary conditions. Moist turbulent convection is in the conditionally unstable regime throughout this study for which unsaturated air parcels are stably and saturated air parcels unstably stratified. A direct comparison of both sets of boundary conditions with the same parameters requires to start the turbulence simulations out of differently saturated equilibrium states. Similar to dry Rayleigh-Benard convection the differences in the turbulent velocity fluctuations, the cloud cover and the convective buoyancy flux decrease across the layer with increasing Rayleigh number. At the highest Rayleigh numbers the system is found in a two-layer regime, a dry cloudless and stably stratified layer with low turbulence level below a fully saturated and cloudy turbulent one which equals classical Rayleigh-Benard convection layer. Both are separated by a strong inversion that gets increasingly narrower for growing Rayleigh number.},

Dyadic Green function and perturbation expansion have been applied to get the slip length quantitatively. In the slip length, both effects of the roughness of the interfaces and the chemical interaction between the liquid and the solid surface are involved. For the numerical calculation, Monte Carlo method has been used to simulate the rough interfaces and the physical quantities are obtained statistically over the interfaces. Results show that the total slip length of the system is linearly proportional to the slip length contributed from the chemical interaction. And the roughness of the interfaces plays its role as the proportionality factor. For the roughness, the variance of the roughness decreases the total slip length while the correlation length of the roughness can enhance the slip length dramatically to a saturation value.},

abstract = {We report an experimental study of the properties of the velocity boundary layer in turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical cell. The measurements were made at Rayleigh numbers R a in the range 2.4 x 10(8) {\textless} Ra {\textless} 5.6 x 10(9) and were conducted with the convection cell tilted with an angle theta relative to gravity, at theta = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.4 degrees, respectively. The fluid was water with Prandtl number Pr = 5.3. It is found that at small tilt angles (theta {\textless}= 1 degrees), the measured viscous boundary layer thickness delta(nu) scales with the Reynolds number Re with an exponent close to that for a Prandtl-Blasius (PB) laminar boundary layer, i.e. delta(nu) similar to Re-0.46 +/- 0.03. For larger tilt angles, the scaling exponent of delta(nu) with Re decreases with theta. The normalized mean horizontal velocity profiles measured at the same tilt angle but with different Ra are found to have an invariant shape. However, for different tilt angles, the shape of the normalized profiles is different. It is also found that the Reynolds number R e based on the maximum mean horizontal velocity scales with Ra as Re similar to Ra-0.43 and the Reynolds number Re-sigma based on the maximum root mean square velocity scales with Ra as Re-sigma similar to Ra-0.55. Within the measurement resolution neither exponent depends on the tilt angle theta. Several wall quantities are also measured directly and their dependencies on R e are found to agree well with those predicted for a classical laminar boundary layer. These are the wall shear stress tau (similar to Re-1.46), the viscous sublayer delta(w) (similar to Re-0.75), the friction velocity u(tau) (similar to Re-0.86) and the skin friction coefficient c(f) (similar to Re-0.46). Again, all of these near-wall quantities do not exhibit a dependence on the tilt angle within the measurement resolution. We also examined the dynamical scaling method proposed by Zhou and Xia (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 104, 2010, p. 104301) and found that in both the laboratory and the dynamical frames the mean velocity profiles show deviations from the theoretical PB profile, with the deviations increasing with Ra. However, profiles obtained from dynamical scaling in general have better agreement with the theoretical profile. It is also found that the effectiveness of this method appears to be independent of Ra.},

abstract = {We present an experimental study of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection with polymer additives made in two convection cells, one with a smooth top and bottom plates and the other with a rough top and bottom plates. For the cell with smooth plates, a reduction of the measured Nusselt number (Nu) was observed. Furthermore, the amount of Nu reduction increases with increasing polymer concentration (c), reaching 12{\%} for c=120 ppm and an apparent leveling off thereafter. For the cell with rough plates, however, an enhancement (4{\%}) of Nu was observed when the polymer concentration is greater than 120 ppm. This increase in Nu is corroborated by an increased large-scale circulation (LSC) velocity in the same cell when polymers are added. In contrast, the LSC velocity in the smooth cell is found to be essentially the same with and without polymers. It is further found that in the smooth cell the rms values of the global Nu, Nu , and that of the local temperature, T , both exhibit similar dependence on c as Nu itself. In contrast, Nu and T in the rough cell are found to be essentially independent of c. 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent thermal convection in a box-shaped domain with regular surface roughness at the heated bottom and cooled top surfaces are conducted for Prandtl number Pr = 0.786 and Rayleigh numbers Ra between 10(6) and 10(8). The surface roughness is introduced by four parallelepiped equidistantly distributed obstacles attached to the bottom plate, and four obstacles located symmetrically at the top plate. By varying Ra and the height and width of the obstacles, we investigate the influence of the regular wall roughness on the turbulent heat transport, measured by the Nusselt number Nu. For fixed Ra, the change in the value of Nu is determined not only by the covering area of the surface, i.e. the obstacle height, but also by the distance between the obstacles. The heat flux enhancement is found to be largest for wide cavities between the obstacles which can be 'washed out' by the flow. This is also manifested in an empirical relation, which is based on the DNS data. We further discuss theoretical limiting cases for very wide and very narrow obstacles and combine them into a simple model for the heat flux enhancement due to the wall roughness, without introducing any free parameters. This model predicts well the general trends and the order of magnitude of the heat flux enhancement obtained in the DNS. In the Nu versus Ra scaling, the obstacles work in two ways: for smaller Ra an increase of the scaling exponent compared to the smooth case is found, which is connected to the heat flux entering the cavities from below. For larger Ra the scaling exponent saturates to the one for smooth plates, which can be understood as a full washing-out of the cavities. The latter is also investigated by considering the strength of the mean secondary flow in the cavities and its relation to the wind (i.e. the large-scale circulation), that develops in the core part of the domain. Generally, an increase in the roughness height leads to stronger flows both in the cavities and in the bulk region, while an increase in the width of the obstacles strengthens only the large-scale circulation of the fluid and weakens the secondary flows. An increase of the Rayleigh number always leads to stronger flows, both in the cavities and in the bulk.},

At the leading order level, the magnitude of temperature fluctuation in the bulk fluid is, again, found to be insensitive to the insulating pattern and mainly depends on the insulating area; while the temperature probability density function (PDF) in the bulk is essentially invariant with respect to both insulating area and the spatial pattern of the lids. The flow dynamics, on the other hand, is sensitive to both the covering area and the spatial distribution of the lids. At fixed {\$}Ra{\_}F{\$}, the flow strength is found to increase with increasing insulating area so as to transfer the same amount of heat through a smaller cooling area. Moreover, for a constant insulating area, a symmetric insulating pattern results in a symmetric flow pattern, i.e. double-roll structure; whereas asymmetric insulating pattern leads to asymmetric flow, i.e. single-roll structure. It is further found that the symmetry breaking of the insulating pattern leads to a stronger flow that enhances the horizontal velocity more than the vertical one.},

Using particle image velocimetry (PIV), we measure the velocity over a wide range of modulation periods {\$}T{\$}. To understand how the flow responds to a given modulation, we calculate the phase delay and amplitude response of the azimuthal velocity. In agreement with earlier theoretical and numerical work, we find that for large modulation periods the system follows the given modulation of the driving, i.e. the system behaves quasi-stationary. For smaller modulation periods, the flow cannot follow the modulation, and the flow velocity responds with a phase delay and a smaller amplitude response to the given modulation. Surprisingly, the local response in the bulk of the flow is independent of the distance to the modulated boundary. Apparently, the turbulent mixing is strong enough to prevent the flow from having radius-dependent responses to the given modulation.},

abstract = {In this paper a numerical procedure to simulate low diffusivity scalar turbulence is presented. The method consists of using a grid for the advected scalar with a higher spatial resolution than that of the momentum. The latter usually requires a less refined mesh and integrating both fields on a single grid tailored to the most demanding variable produces an unnecessary computational overhead. A multiple resolution approach is used also in the time integration in order to maintain the stability of the scalars on the finer grid. The method is the more advantageous the less diffusive the scalar is with respect to momentum, therefore it is particularly well suited for large Prandtl or Schmidt number flows. However, even in the case of equal diffusivities the present procedure gives CPU time and memory occupation savings, due to the increased gradients and more intermittent behaviour of the scalars when compared to momentum.},

The axial flow was found to convect the TRs without any weakening effect. For small-gap TC flow, evidence was found for the existence of logarithmic velocity fluctuations, and of an overlap layer, in which the velocity fluctuations collapse in outer units. Profiles consistent with a logarithmic dependence were also found for the angular velocity in large-gap TC flow, albeit in a very reduced range of scales. Finally, the behaviour of both small- and large-gap TC flow was compared to other canonical flows. Small-gap TC flow has similar behaviour in the near-wall region to other canonical flows, while large-gap TC flow displays very different behaviour. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We report the first experimental study of Lagrangian acceleration in turbulent Rayleigh–B´ enard convection, using particle tracking velocimetry. A method has been developed to quantitatively evaluate and eliminate the uncertainties induced by temperature and refraction index fluctuations caused by the thermal plumes. It is found that the acceleration p.d.f. exhibits a stretched exponential form and that the probability for large magnitude of acceleration in the lateral direction is higher than those in the vertical directions, which can be attributed to the vortical motion of the thermal plumes. The local acceleration variance ?a2? was obtained for various values of the three control parameters: the Rayleigh number Ra (6×108 ?Ra?1×1011), the Prandtl number Pr (Pr =4.4, 5.5 and 6.1) and the system size L (L = 19.2 and 48.6 cm). These were then compared with the theoretically predicted dependence on these parameters for buoyancy-dominated turbulent flows and for homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, respectively. It is found that ?a2? in the central region is dominated by contributions from the turbulent background rather than from the buoyancy force, and the Heisenberg–Yaglom relation holds in this region. From this, we obtain the first experimental results of the constant a0 of the acceleration variance in the micro-scale Reynolds number range 20 ? R$\lambda$ ? 120, which fills a gap in this constant in the lower R$\lambda$ end from the experimental side, and provides possible constraints for its high R$\lambda$ behaviour if a certain fitting function is attempted. In addition, acceleration correlation functions were obtained for different Ra. It is found that the zero crossing time of acceleration correlation functions is at $\tau$ ≈ 2.2$\tau$$\eta$ ($\tau$$\eta$ is the Kolmogorov time scale) over the range of Ra(R$\lambda$) spanned in our experiments, which is the same as the simulation results in isotropic turbulence, and the exponential decay time $\tau$1/e =(1.12±0.05)$\tau$$\eta$, which is larger than (0.73∼0.80)$\tau$$\eta$ found experimentally for other types of turbulent flows with larger R$\lambda$.},

In the dissipative range of scales we observed for the first time in experiment the exponential growth of the separation between a pair of particles predicted by Batchelor and obtained a Batchelor constant 0.23$\backslash$pm0.07. For large r0, it is found that, for almost all time range, both the mean-square separation and distance neighbor function exhibit the forms predicted by Batchelor, whereas the two quantities agree with Richardson's predictions for small r0. Moreover, the measured value of the Richardson constant g = 0.10 $\backslash$pm 0.07, which is smaller than those found in other turbulence systems. We also demonstrate the crossover of the mean-square separation from the exponential to the Batchelor regimes in both temporal and spatial scales.},

abstract = {Turbulent convection occurs when the Rayleigh number (Ra)--which quantifies the relative magnitude of thermal driving to dissipative forces in the fluid motion--becomes sufficiently high. Although many theoretical and experimental studies of turbulent convection exist, the basic properties of heat transport remain unclear. One important question concerns the existence of an asymptotic regime that is supposed to occur at very high Ra. Theory predicts that in such a state the Nusselt number (Nu), representing the global heat transport, should scale as Nu proportional to Ra(beta) with beta = 1/2. Here we investigate thermal transport over eleven orders of magnitude of the Rayleigh number (10(6) {\textless} or = Ra {\textless} or = 10(7)), using cryogenic helium gas as the working fluid. Our data, over the entire range of Ra, can be described to the lowest order by a single power-law with scaling exponent beta close to 0.31. In particular, we find no evidence for a transition to the Ra(1/2) regime. We also study the variation of internal temperature fluctuations with Ra, and probe velocity statistics indirectly.},

abstract = {Turbulent convection occurs when the Rayleigh number (Ra)--which quantifies the relative magnitude of thermal driving to dissipative forces in the fluid motion--becomes sufficiently high. Although many theoretical and experimental studies of turbulent convection exist, the basic properties of heat transport remain unclear. One important question concerns the existence of an asymptotic regime that is supposed to occur at very high Ra. Theory predicts that in such a state the Nusselt number (Nu), representing the global heat transport, should scale as Nu proportional to Ra(beta) with beta = 1/2. Here we investigate thermal transport over eleven orders of magnitude of the Rayleigh number (10(6) {\textless} or = Ra {\textless} or = 10(7)), using cryogenic helium gas as the working fluid. Our data, over the entire range of Ra, can be described to the lowest order by a single power-law with scaling exponent beta close to 0.31. In particular, we find no evidence for a transition to the Ra(1/2) regime. We also study the variation of internal temperature fluctuations with Ra, and probe velocity statistics indirectly.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of and to model the processes controlling the amplitude of the wind of Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection. We analyze results from direct simulation of an L/H=4 aspect-ratio domain with periodic sidewalls at Ra=(10(5), 10(6), 10(7), 10(8)) and at Pr=1 by decomposing independent realizations into wind and fluctuations. It is shown that, deep inside the thermal boundary layer, horizontal heat fluxes exceed the average vertical heat flux by a factor of 3 due to the interaction between the wind and the mean temperature field. These large horizontal heat fluxes are responsible for spatial temperature differences that drive the wind by creating pressure gradients. The wall fluxes and turbulent mixing in the bulk provide damping. Using the direct numerical simulation results to parametrize the unclosed terms, a simple model capturing the essential processes governing the wind structure is derived. The model consists of two coupled differential equations for wind velocity and temperature amplitude. The equations indicate that the formation of a wind structure is inevitable due to the positive feedback resulting from the interaction between the wind and temperature field. Furthermore, the wind velocity is largely determined by the turbulence in the bulk rather than by the wall-shear stress. The model reproduces the Ra dependence of wind Reynolds number and temperature amplitude.},

abstract = {We consider the numerical simulation of Rayleigh-Benard convection in a 2D square cell filled with water (Pr = 4.3) at a turbulent Rayleigh number of Ra = 5 x 10(7). We focus on the structures and dynamics of the large-scale intermittent flow. Two quasi-stable flow patterns are identified: one consists of a main diagonal roll with two corner rolls; and the other of two horizontally stacked rolls. These stable flow structures are associated with two types of events, which involve corner flow growth and pattern rotation: reversals, when the main roll rapidly switches signs; and cessations, when it disappears for longer periods. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied independently to the velocity field and to the temperature field. In both cases, three principal modes were identified: a single-roll, large-scale circulation; a quadrupolar flow; and a double-roll, symmetry-breaking mode. The large-scale circulation is the kinetic mode with the highest energy. The most energetic temperature mode is associated with the mean temperature and corresponds to a velocity field of quadrupolar nature. The vertical heat flux is concentrated in these two modes. The reversal process is characterized by sharp fluctuations in the amplitudes of all modes. Analysis of the interaction coefficients between the spatial modes leads us to propose a three-dimensional model, based on the interaction of the large-scale circulation, the quadrupolar flow and horizontal rolls. The main dynamics and time scales of reversals and cessations are reproduced by the model in the presence of noise.},

Using autocorrelation functions derived from high-resolution time series of temperature and velocity near the cooling plate we demonstrate that the well-known single-roll structure (often called "wind") breaks down when the aspect ratio increases beyond the critical value Gamma(1) = 1.68+/-0.22. We further show that at Gamma(2) = 3.66+/-0.46 a second transition from an oscillatory two-roll structure to an unstable multi-roll structure takes place. The value of Gamma(2) represents a lower bound for the aspect ratio that is necessary to reach homogeneous convection--a turbulent state that is free from the influence of lateral walls.},

abstract = {We report high-resolution local-temperature measurements in the upper boundary layer of turbulent Rayleigh - B{\'{e}}nard (RB) convection with variable Rayleigh number Ra and aspect ratio $\Gamma$. The primary purpose of the work is to create a comprehensive data set of temperature profiles against which various phenomenological theories and numerical simulations can be tested. We performed two series of measurements for air (Pr = 0.7) in a cylindrical container, which cover a range from Ra ≈ 109 to 1012 and form $\Gamma$ ≈ 1 to ≈ 10. In the first series $\Gamma$ was varied while the temperature difference was kept constant, whereas in the second series the aspect ratio was set to its lowest possible value, $\Gamma$ 1.13 and Ra was varied by changing the temperature difference. We present the profiles of the mean temperature, root-mean-square (r.m.s.) temperature fluctuation, skewness and kurtosis as functions of the vertical distance z from the cooling plate. Outside the (very short) linear part of the thermal boundary layer the non-dimensional mean temperature $\theta$ is found to scale as $\theta$ (z) ∼ z$\alpha$, the exponent $\alpha$ ≈ 0.5 depending only weakly on Ra and $\Gamma$. This result supports neither Prandtl's one-third law nor a logarithmic scaling law for the mean temperature. The r.m.s. temperature fluctuation $\sigma$ is found to decay with increasing distance from the cooling plate according to sigma; (z) ∼ z$\beta$, where the value of $\beta$ is in the range -0.30 {\textgreater} $\beta$ {\textgreater} -0.42 and depends on both Ra and $\Gamma$. Priestley's $\beta$ = -1/3 law is consistent with this finding but cannot explain the variation in the scaling exponent. In addition to profiles we also present and discuss boundary-layer thicknesses, Nusselt numbers and their scaling with Ra and $\Gamma$. {\textcopyright} 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces have attracted much attention lately as they present the possibility of achieving a substantial skin-friction drag reduction in turbulent flows. In this paper, the effects of a superhydrophobic surface, consisting of microgrates aligned in the flow direction, on skin-friction drag in turbulent flows were investigated through direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows. The superhydrophobic surface was modeled through a shear-free boundary condition on the air-water interface. Dependence of the effective slip length and resulting skin-friction drag on Reynolds number and surface geometry was examined. In laminar flows, the effective slip length depended on surface geometry only, independent of Reynolds number, consistent with an existing analysis. In turbulent flows, the effective slip length was a function of Reynolds number, indicating its dependence on flow conditions near the surface. The resulting drag reduction was much larger in turbulent flows than in laminar flows, and near-wall turbulence structures were significantly modified, suggesting that indirect effects resulting from modified turbulence structures played a more significant role in reducing drag in turbulent flows than the direct effect of the slip, which led to a modest drag reduction in laminar flows. It was found that the drag reduction in turbulent flows was well correlated with the effective slip length normalized by viscous wall units.},

abstract = {Superhydrophobic surfaces can retain gas pockets within their microscale textures when submerged in water. This property reduces direct contact between water and solid surfaces and presents opportunities for improving hydrodynamic performance by decreasing viscous drag. In most realistic applications, however, the flow regime is turbulent and retaining the gas pockets is a challenge. In order to overcome this challenge, it is crucial to develop an understanding of physical mechanisms that can lead to the failure of superhydrophobic surfaces in retaining gas pockets when the overlying liquid flow is turbulent. We present a study of the onset of failure in gas retention by analysing direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent flows over superhydrophobic surfaces coupled with the deformation of air–water interfaces that hold the gas pockets. The superhydrophobic surfaces are modelled as periodic textures with patterned slip and no-slip boundary conditions on the overlying water flow. The liquid–gas interface is modelled via a linearized Young–Laplace equation, which is solved coupled with the overlying turbulent flow. A wide range of texture sizes and interfacial Weber numbers are considered in this study. Our analysis identifies flow-induced upstream-travelling capillary waves that are coherent in the spanwise direction as one mechanism for failure in retention of gas pockets. To confirm physical understanding of these waves, a semianalytical inviscid linear analysis is developed; the wave speeds obtained from the space–time correlations in the DNS data were found to match with the predictions of the semianalytical model. The magnitude of the pressure fluctuations due to these waves was found to increase with decreasing surface tension, and increase with a much stronger dependence on the slip velocity, when all numbers are reported in wall units. Based on a fitted scaling, a threshold criterion for the failure of superhydrophobic surfaces is developed that is based on estimates of the onset condition required for the motion of contact lines. The second contribution of this work is the development of boundary maps that identify stable and unstable zones in a parameter space consisting of working parameter and design parameters including texture size and material contact angle. We provide a brief description of previously identified failure modes of superhydrophobic surfaces, namely the stagnation pressure and shear-driven drainage mechanisms. In an overlay map, the stable and unstable zones due to each mechanism are presented. For various input conditions, we provide scaling laws that identify the most critical mechanism limiting the stability of gas retention by superhydrophobic surfaces.},

abstract = {An extreme dissipation event in the bulk of a closed three-dimensional turbulent convection cell is found to be correlated with a strong reduction of the large-scale circulation flow in the system that happens at the same time as a plume emission event from the bottom plate. The reduction in the large-scale circulation opens the possibility for a nearly frontal collision of down- and upwelling plumes and the generation of a high-amplitude thermal dissipation layer in the bulk. This collision is locally connected to a subsequent high-amplitude energy dissipation event in the form of a strong shear layer. Our analysis illustrates the impact of transitions in the large-scale structures on extreme events at the smallest scales of the turbulence, a direct link that is observed in a flow with boundary layers. We also show that detection of extreme dissipation events which determine the far-tail statistics of the dissipation fields in the bulk requires long-time integrations of the equations of motion over at least a hundred convective time units. 2016 American Physical Society.},

We continue with a detailed asymptotic analysis using the method of matched asymptotic expansions, where 'inner' solutions valid close to the solid segments are matched with 'outer' solutions valid on the scale of the periodicity, where the bubbles protruding from the solid grooves appear to touch. The analysis yields asymptotic expansions for the effective slip length in each of the protrusion-angle regimes. These expansions overlap for intermediate protrusion angles, which allows us to form a uniformly valid approximation for arbitrary protrusion angles 0 $\alpha$ $\pi$/2. We thereby explicitly describe the transition with increasing protrusion angle from a logarithmic to an algebraic small-solid-fraction slip-length singularity.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Superhydrophobic surfaces can entrap gas pockets within their grooves when submerged in water. Such a mixed-phase boundary is shown to result in an effective slip velocity on the surface, and has promising potential for drag reduction and energy-saving in hydrodynamic applications. The target flow regime, in most such applications, is a turbulent flow. Previous analyses of this problem involved direct numerical simulations of turbulence with the superhydrophobic surface modelled as a flat boundary, but with a heterogeneous mix of slip and no-slip boundary conditions corresponding to the surface texture. Analysis of the kinematic data from these simulations has helped to establish the magnitude of drag reduction for various texture topologies. The present work is the first investigation that, alongside a kinematic investigation, addresses the robustness of superhydrophobic surfaces by studying the load fields obtain from data from direct numerical simulations (DNS). The key questions at the focus of this work are: does a superhydrophobic surface induce a different pressure field compared to a flat surface? If so, how does this difference scale with system parameters, and when does it become significant that it can deform the air–water interface and potentially rapture the entrapped gas pockets? To this end, we have performed DNS of turbulent channel flows subject to superhydrophobic surfaces over a wide range of texture sizes spanning values from {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S002211201500573X{\_}inline1" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}L{\^{}}{\{}+{\}}=6{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} to {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S002211201500573X{\_}inline2" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}L{\^{}}{\{}+{\}}=155{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} when expressed in terms of viscous units. The pressure statistics at the wall are decomposed into two contributions: one coherent, caused by the stagnation of slipping flow hitting solid posts, and one time-dependent, caused by overlying turbulence. The results show that the larger texture size intensifies the contribution of stagnation pressure, while the contribution from turbulence is essentially insensitive to {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S002211201500573X{\_}inline3" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}L{\^{}}{\{}+{\}}{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} .

The scaling of the induced pressure and the consequent deformations of the air–water interface are analysed.

abstract = {We compute fully local boundary layer scales in three-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection. These scales are directly connected to the highly intermittent fluctuations of the fluxes of momentum and heat at the isothermal top and bottom walls and are statistically distributed around the corresponding mean thickness scales. The local boundary layer scales also reflect the strong spatial inhomogeneities of both boundary layers due to the large-scale, but complex and intermittent, circulation that builds up in closed convection cells. Similar to turbulent boundary layers, we define inner scales based on local shear stress which can be consistently extended to the classical viscous scales in bulk turbulence, e.g. the Kolmogorov scale, and outer scales based on slopes at the wall. We discuss the consequences of our generalization, in particular the scaling of our inner and outer boundary layer thicknesses and the resulting shear Reynolds number with respect to Rayleigh number. The mean outer thickness scale for the temperature field is close to the standard definition of a thermal boundary layer thickness. In the case of the velocity field, under certain conditions the outer scale follows a similar scaling as the Prandtl-Blasius type definition with respect to Rayleigh number, but differs quantitatively. The friction coefficient c{\_}epsilon scaling is found to fall right between the laminar and turbulent limits which indicates that the boundary layer exhibits transitional behavior. Additionally, we conduct an analysis of the recently suggested dissipation layer thickness scales versus Rayleigh number and find a transition in the scaling. We also performed one study of aspect ratio equal to three in the case of Ra=1e+8.},

abstract = {Rotating Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection exhibits, in the limit of rapid rotation, a turbulent state known as geostrophic turbulence. This state is present for sufficiently large Rayleigh numbers representing the thermal forcing of the system, and is characterized by a leading order balance between the Coriolis force and pressure gradient. This turbulent state is itself unstable to the generation of depth-independent or barotropic vortex structures of ever larger scale through a process known as spectral condensation. This process involves an inverse cascade mechanism with a positive feedback loop whereby large-scale barotropic vortices organize small scale convective eddies. In turn, these eddies provide a dynamically evolving energy source for the large-scale barotropic component. Kinetic energy spectra for the barotropic dynamics are consistent with a k-3 downscale enstrophy cascade and an upscale cascade that steepens to k-3 as the box-scale condensate forms. At the same time the flow maintains a baroclinic convective component with an inertial range consistent with a k-5/3 spectrum. The condensation process resembles a similar process in two dimensions but is fully three-dimensional. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

The roughness is introduced by a set of rectangular heated/cooled obstacles located at the corresponding plates. An analytical model to estimate the Nusselt number deviations caused by the wall roughness is developed. It is based on the two-dimensional Prandtl–Blasius boundary layer equations and therefore is valid for moderate Rayleigh numbers and regular wall roughness, for which the height of the obstacles and the distances between them are significantly larger than the thickness of the thermal boundary layers. To validate this model, the transport of heat and momentum in rectangular convection cells is studied in two-dimensional Navier–Stokes simulations, for different aspect ratios of the obstacles. It is found that the model predicts the heat transport with errors ?6{\%} for all investigated cases.},

abstract = {We report an investigation of temperature profiles in turbulent Rayleigh–B´enard convection of water based on direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a cylindrical cell with unit aspect ratio for the same Prandtl number Pr and similar Rayleigh numbers Ra as used in recent high-precision measurements by Funfschilling et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 536, 2005, p. 145). The Nusselt numbers Nu computed for Pr =4.38 and Ra =108,3×108,5×108,8×108 and 109 are found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data corrected for finite thermal conductivity of the walls. Based on this successful validation of the numerical approach, the DNS data are used to extract vertical profiles of the mean temperature. We find that near the heating and cooling plates the non-dimensional temperature profiles $\Theta$(y)(where y is the non-dimensional vertical coordinate), obey neither a logarithmic nor a power law. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Prandtl–Blasius boundary layer theory cannot predict the shape of the temperature profile with an error less than 7.9{\%} within the thermal boundary layers (TBLs). We further show that the profiles can be approximated by a universal stretched exponential of the form $\Theta$(y)≈1−exp(−y −0.5y2) with an absolute error less than 1.1{\%} within the TBLs and 5.5{\%} in the whole Rayleigh cell. Finally, we provide more accurate analytical approximations of the profiles involving higher order polynomials in the approximation. enard convection of water ETHESS2 449},

Evaluating the thermal dissipation rates from the generated DNS data, the formation and development of the thermal Plumes and their interaction are highlighted. Two new functions a and T are defined to determine quantitatively the role of the turbulent background. Evaluating these functions from the DNS data, it is shown that the turbulent background pushes the thermal plumes back and that its contribution to the volume-averaged thermal dissipation rate increases with the Rayleigh number. Further, it is proven analytically that the ratio of the area-averaged (over the top or the bottom plates) to the volume-averaged thermal dissipation rate is greater than or equal to the Nusselt number for all aspect ratios, and Prandtl and Rayleigh numbers.},

The measured J(r) in the bulk region shows a different scaling behavior with varying Rayleigh numbers compared with that measured in the plume-dominated regions near the sidewall and near the lower conducting plate. The local transport measurements thus allow us to disentangle boundary and bulk contributions to the total heat flux and directly check their respective scaling behavior against the theoretical predictions.},

Large fluctuations of the local convective heat flux are found mainly in the vertical direction and they are determined primarily by the thermal plumes in the system.

abstract = {Using numerical simulations of rapidly rotating Boussinesq convection in a Cartesian box, we study the formation of long-lived, large-scale, depth-invariant coherent structures. These structures, which consist of concentrated cyclones, grow to the horizontal size of the box, with velocities significantly larger than the convective motions. We vary the rotation rate, the thermal driving and the aspect ratio in order to determine the domain of existence of these large-scale vortices (LSV). We find that two conditions are required for their formation. First, the Rayleigh number, a meaure of the thermal driving, must be several times its value at the linear onset of convection; this corresponds to Reynolds numbers, based on the convective velocity and the box depth, {\$}\backslashgtrsim 100{\$}. Second, the rotational constraint on the convection structures must be strong. This requires that the local Rossby number, based on the convective velocity and the horizontal convective scale, {\$}\backslashlesssim 0.15{\$}. Simulations in which certain wavenumbers are artificially suppressed in spectral space suggest that the LSV are produced by the interactions of small-scale, depth-dependent convective motions. The presence of LSV significantly reduces the efficiency of the convective heat transport.},

Here, we report a unique technique of noncontact viscoelastic imaging of live cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a long-needle glass probe. Because only the probe tip is placed in a liquid medium near the cell surface, the AFM cantilever in air functions well under dual-frequency modulation, retaining its high-quality resonant modes. The probe tip interacts with the cell surface through a minute hydrodynamic flow in the nanometer-thin gap region between them without physical contact. Quantitative measurements of the cell height, volume, and Young's modulus are conducted simultaneously. The experiment demonstrates that the long-needle AFM has a wide range of applications in the study of cell mechanics.},

abstract = {In the study, the influence of cell tilting on flow dynamics is explored experimentally in a rectangular cell (aspect ratios Gamma(x) = 1 and Gamma(y) = 0.25 ). The measurements are carried out in a wide range of tilt angles (0 {\textless}= beta {\textless}= pi/2 rad) at Prandtl number (Pr similar or equal to 6.3 ) and Rayleigh number (Ra similar or equal to 4.42 x 10(9) ). With the velocity measurements, the large-scale circulation (LSC) is found to be sensitive to the symmetry of the system. In the level case, the LSC is at about quarter width of the cell. As the cell is slightly tilted (beta similar or equal to 0.04 rad), the LSC moves quickly towards the boundary. With increasing beta , the LSC changes gradually from oblique ellipse-like to square-like, and to more complicated patterns. Oscillation has been found for almost all beta, and are strongest at around beta similar or equal to 0.48 rad. As beta increases, the Reynolds number (Re) initially also increases, until it reaches its maximum at the transition angle beta = 0 .15 rad, after which it gradually decreases. The cell tilting causes a pronounced reduction of the Nusselt number (Nu). As beta increases from 0 to 0.15, 1.05 and pi/2 rad, the reduction of Nu is approximately 1.4 {\%}, 5{\%} and 18 {\%}, respectively. Over the ranges of 0 {\textless}= beta {\textless}= 0.15 rad, 0.15 {\textless}= beta {\textless}= 1.05 rad and 1.05 {\textless}= beta {\textless}= pi/2 rad, the decay slopes are 8.57 x 10 (2), 3.27 x 10 (2) and 0.24 rad (-1), respectively.},

A unified model based on force-assisted barrier-crossing is used to connect the mesoscopic measurements of CFH and CL relaxation with the energy barrier hight Eb and size $\lambda$ associated with the surface defects. The experiment demonstrates that the CL pinning (relaxation) and depinning dynamics are closely related and can be described by a common microscopic framework.},

abstract = {Very different types of scaling of the Nusselt number Nu with the Rayleigh number Ra have experimentally been found in the very large Ra regime beyond 10(11). We understand and interpret these results by extending the unifying theory of thermal convection [Grossmann and Lohse, Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3316 (2001)] to the very large Ra regime where the kinetic boundary-layer is turbulent. The central idea is that the spatial extension of this turbulent boundary-layer with a logarithmic velocity profile is comparable to the size of the cell. Depending on whether the thermal transport is plume dominated, dominated by the background thermal fluctuations, or whether also the thermal boundary-layer is fully turbulent (leading to a logarithmic temperature profile), we obtain effective scaling laws of about Nu proportional to Ra-0.14, Nu proportional to Ra-0.22, and Nu proportional to Ra-0.38, respectively. Depending on the initial conditions or random fluctuations, one or the other of these states may be realized. Since the theory is for both the heat flux Nu and the velocity amplitude Re, we can also give the scaling of the latter, namely, Re proportional to Ra-0.42, Re proportional to Ra-0.45, and Re proportional to Ra-0.50 in the respective ranges.

abstract = {A systematic theory for the scaling of the Nusselt number {\$}Nu{\$} and of the Reynolds number {\$}Re{\$} in strong Rayleigh-Benard convection is suggested and shown to be compatible with recent experiments. It assumes a coherent large scale convection roll (``wind of turbulence'') and is based on the dynamical equations both in the bulk and in the boundary layers. Several regimes are identified in the Rayleigh number versus Prandtl number phase space, defined by whether the boundary layer or the bulk dominates the global kinetic and thermal dissipation, respectively. The crossover between the regimes is calculated. In the regime which has most frequently been studied in experiment (Ra smaller than 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}) the leading terms are {\$}Nu\backslashsim Ra{\^{}}{\{}1/4{\}}Pr{\^{}}{\{}1/8{\}}{\$}, {\$}Re \backslashsim Ra{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}} Pr{\^{}}{\{}-3/4{\}}{\$} for {\$}Pr {\textless} 1{\$} and {\$}Nu\backslashsim Ra{\^{}}{\{}1/4{\}}Pr{\^{}}{\{}-1/12{\}}{\$}, {\$}Re \backslashsim Ra{\^{}}{\{}1/2{\}} Pr{\^{}}{\{}-5/6{\}}{\$} for {\$}Pr {\textgreater} 1{\$}.

It is the convection term (u⋅∇)u in the equation of motion which rules the transition to turbulence by introducing a subtle interplay between the nonnormal bunching of flow perturbations and their nonlinear interaction. By nonnormal coupling to the basic laminar flow, those disturbances which are misfit to the eigendirections can transiently draw energy from the laminar shear flow and grow before they ultimately fade away. If their intermediate growth is strong enough, they interact nonlinearly. This interaction recreates new misfit flow amplitudes, which again start drawing energy, grow transiently, interact, etc. This feedback loop is able to sustain a flow which, as a consequence of the nonlinearity, is spatiotemporally deterministic and irregular at the same time. We call this flow turbulent. The feedback mechanism has to be contrasted to that of a common instability. The laminar flow stays linearly stable, all eigenvalues have negative, damping real parts. That is, laminar shear flow passes to turbulence without (linear) instability. The onset of turbulence is the nonnormal-nonlinear performance of many degrees of freedom and not merely of a single, unstable one. Both features are mediated by the convective nonlinearity.},

The condensation and/or dissolution rates of departed bubbles revealed two regimes: the initial rate was influenced by steep thermal gradients across the thermal boundary layer near the plate and was two orders of magnitude larger than the final condensation and/or dissolution rate that prevailed once the rising bubbles were in the colder bulk flow of nearly uniform temperature. The dynamics of thermal plumes was studied qualitatively in the presence and absence of nucleating bubbles. It was found that bubbles enhanced the plume velocity by a factor of four or so and drove a large-scale circulation (LSC). Nonetheless, even in the presence of bubbles the plumes and LSC had a characteristic velocity which was smaller by a factor of five or so than the bubble-rise velocity in the bulk. In the absence of bubbles there was strongly turbulent convection but no LSC, and plumes on average rose vertically. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We then focus on how space-time correlations are used to develop time-accurate turbulence models for the large-eddy simulation of turbulence-generated noise and particle-laden turbulence.Webriefly discuss their applications to two-point closures for Kolmogorov?s universal scaling of energy spectra and to the reconstruction of space-time energy spectra from a subset of spatial and temporal signals in experimental measurements. Finally, we summarize the current understanding of space-time correlations and conclude with future issues for the field. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics Volume 49 is January 03, 2017. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/catalog/pubdates.aspx for revised estimates.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It is found that LB,centre does not necessarily exhibit the same scaling as LB,global. While LB,global is monotonically deceasing as LB,global {\~{}} Ra-0.10 for both Pr, LB,centre shows a steep increase beyond a certain Ra value. The complex scaling of the local Bolgiano length scale in the centre is a result of the different behaviour of the temperature-variance dissipation rate, ∈T, and the turbulent-kinetic-energy dissipation rate, ∈u. This shows that for sufficiently high Ra the flow is well-mixed and hence temperature is passively advected. It is also observed that the Ra-range in which L B,centre exhibits the same scaling as the global Bolgiano length scale is increasing with increasing Pr. It is further observed that for Pr = 4.38 and Ra ≤ 3 × 107 the local vertical heat flux in the centre region is balanced by the turbulent-kinetic-energy dissipation rate. For higher Ra we find that the local heat flux is decreasing. At Pr = 0.7 we do not observe such a balance, as the measured heat flux is between the heat fluxes estimated through the turbulent-kinetic-energy dissipationrate and the temperature-variance dissipation rate. We therefore suggest that the balance of the local heat flux might be Prandtl-number dependent. The conditional average ofthe local vertical heat flux 〈Nu|∈u,∈ T〉centre in the core region of the flow reveals that the highest vertical heat flux occurs for rare events with very high dissipation rates, while the joint most probable dissipation rates are associated with very low values of vertical heat flux. It is alsoobserved that high values of ∈u and ∈T tend to occur together. It is further observed that the longitudinal velocity structure functions approach Kolmogorov K41 scaling. The temperature structure functions appear to approach Bolgiano-Obukhov BO59 scaling for r {\textgreater} LB,centre, while a scaling exponent smaller than the BO59 scaling is observed for separations r {\textless} L B,centre. The mixed velocity and temperature structure function for Ra = 1 × 109 and Pr = 4.38 shows a short 4/5 -scaling for r {\textgreater} LB,centre. Our results suggest that BO59 scaling might be more clearly observable at higher Prandtl and moderate Rayleigh numbers. {\textcopyright}2013 Cambridge University Press.},

Inside the air layer, both the shear-driven flow and recirculating flow with zero net mass flow rate are considered. With increasing air-layer thickness, the slip length, slip velocity and percentage of drag reduction increase. It is shown that the slip length is independent of the water flow and depends only on the air-layer geometry.

Two configurations were examined: one had a constant heat flux at the bottom boundary and a constant temperature at the top (CFCT cell); the other had constant temperatures at both boundaries (CTCT cell). In addition to producing different temperature stability in the boundary layers, the differences in the boundary condition lead to rather unexpected changes in the flow dynamics. It is found that, surprisingly, reversals of the large-scale circulation occur more frequently in the CTCT cell than in the CFCT cell, despite the fact that in the former its flow strength is on average 9{\%} larger than that in the latter.

abstract = {We report an experimental and numerical study of the effect of spatial confinement in turbulent thermal convection. It is found that when the width of the convection cell is narrowed, the heat-transfer efficiency increases significantly despite the fact that the overall flow is slowed down by the increased drag force from the sidewalls. Detailed experimental and numerical studies show that this enhancement is brought about by the changes in the dynamics and morphology of the thermal plumes in the boundary layers and in the large-scale flow structures in the bulk. It is found that the confined geometry produces more coherent and energetic hot and cold plume clusters that go up and down in random locations, resulting in more uniform and thinner thermal boundary layers. The study demonstrates how changes in turbulent bulk flow can influence the boundary layer dynamics and shows that the prevalent mode of heat transfer existing in larger aspect ratio convection cells, in which hot and cold thermal plumes are carried by the large-scale circulation along opposite sides of the sidewall, is not the most efficient way for heat transport.},

abstract = {We present experimental results for the Reynolds number Re-U based on the horizontal mean-flow velocity U and for Re-V based on the root-mean-square horizontal fluctuation velocity V for turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cylindrical sample of aspect ratio Gamma = 10.9 over the Prandtl number range 0.18 {\textless}= Pr {\textless}= 0.88. The results were derived from space-time cross-correlation functions of shadowgraph images, using the elliptic approximation of He {\&} Zhang (Phys. Rev. E, vol. 73, 2006, 055303). The data cover the Rayleigh number range from 3 x 10(5) to 2 x 10(7). We find that Re-U is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the values given by the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) model (Grossmann {\&} Lohse, Phys. Rev. E, vol. 66, 2002, 016305) for Gamma = 1.00 and attribute this difference to averaging caused by lateral random diffusion of the large-scale circulation cells in large-Gamma samples. For the fluctuations we found Re-V = (R) over tilde (0PrRa eta)-Ra-alpha, with (R) over tilde (0) = 0.31, alpha = -0.53 +/- 0.11 and eta = 0.45 +/- 0.03. That result agrees well with the GL model. The close agreement of the coefficient (R) over tilde (0) must be regarded as a coincidence because the GL model was for Gamma = 1.00 and for a mean-flow velocity U.},

abstract = {Rotating Rayleigh-Benard convection in water is studied in direct numerical simulations, where the temperature dependence of the viscosity, the thermal conductivity, and the density within the buoyancy term is taken into account. In all simulations, the arithmetic mean of the lowest and highest temperature in the system equals 40 degrees C, corresponding to a Prandtl number of Pr = 4.38. In the non-rotational case, the Rayleigh number Ra ranges from 10(7) to 1.16 x 10(9) and temperature differences Delta up to 70 K are considered, whereas in the rotational case the inverse Rossby number range from 0.07 {\textless}= 1/ R0 {\textless}= 14.1 is studied for Delta = 40K with the focus on Ra = 10(8). The non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects in water are reflected in an up to 5.5K enhancement of the center temperature and in an up to 5{\%} reduction of the Nusselt number. The top thermal and viscous boundary layer thicknesses increase and the bottom ones decrease, while the sum of the corresponding top and bottom thicknesses remains as in the classical Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) case. Rotation applied to NOB thermal convection reduces the central temperature enhancement. Under NOB conditions the top (bottom) thermal and viscous boundary layers become equal for a slightly larger (smaller) inverse Rossby number than in the OB case. Furthermore, for rapid rotation the thermal bottom boundary layers become thicker than the top ones. The Nusselt number normalized by that in the non-rotating case depends similarly on 1/Ro in both, the NOB and the OB cases. The deviation between the Nusselt number under OB and NOB conditions is minimal when the thermal and viscous boundary layers are equal. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

We propose a method to capture regime transitions based on the decomposition of the velocity field into toroidal and poloidal parts. We identify four different regimes. First, a buoyancy-dominated regime occurring while the toroidal energy etor is not affected by rotation and remains equal to that in the non-rotating case, e(tor)(0). Second, a rotation-influenced regime, starting at rotation rates where e(tor) {\textgreater} e(tor)(0) and ending at a critical inverse Rossby number 1/R0(cr) that is determined by the balance of the toroidal and poloidal energy, e(tor) = e(pol). Third, a rotation-dominated regime, where the toroidal energy e(tor) is larger than both e(pol) and e(tor)(0). Fourth, a geostrophic regime for high rotation rates where the toroidal energy drops below the value for non-rotating convection.},

SHSs combine surface roughness with hydrophobicity and can, in some cases, support a shear-free air–water interface. Slip velocities, wall shear stresses and Reynolds stresses are considered for a variety of SHS microfeature geometry configurations at a friction Reynolds number of Re$\tau$ ≈180. For the largest microfeature spacing studied, an average slip velocity over 75{\%} of the bulk velocity is obtained, and the wall shear stress reduction is found to be nearly 40 {\%}. The simulation results suggest that the mean velocity profile near the superhydrophobic wall continues to scale with the wall shear stress but is offset by a slip velocity that increases with increasing microfeature spacing.},

abstract = {We report laboratory and numerical experiments with the convective circulation that develops in a long channel driven by heating and cooling through opposite halves of the horizontal base. The problem is similar to that posed by Stommel (Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. vol. 48, 1962, p. 766) and Rossby (Deep-Sea Res. vol. 12, 1965, p. 9; Tellus vol. 50, 1998, p. 242), where flow forced by a linear temperature variation along the ocean surface or the base of a tank presented a demonstration of the smallness of sinking regions in the meridional overturning circulation of the oceans. In contrast to the previous experiments, we use small aspect ratio, larger Rayleigh numbers, piecewise uniform boundary conditions and an imposed input heat flux. The flow is characterized by a vigorous overturning circulation cell filling the box length and depth. A stable thermocline forms above the cooled base and is advected over the heated part of the base, where it is eroded from below by small-scale three-dimensional convection, forming a 'convective mixed layer'. At the endwall, the convective mixing is overshadowed by a narrow but turbulent plume rising through the full depth of the box. The return flow along the top of the box is turbulent with large slowly migrating eddies, and occupies approximately a third of the total depth. Theoretical scaling laws give temperature differences, thermocline thickness and velocities that are in good agreement with the experimental data and two-dimensional numerical solutions. The measured and computed density structure is largely similar to the thermocline and abyssal stratification in the oceans.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of the turbulent temporally evolving cloud-top mixing layer are used to investigate the role of evaporative cooling by isobaric mixing locally at the stratocumulus top. It is shown that the system develops a horizontal layered structure whose evolution is determined by molecular transport. A relatively thin inversion with a constant thickness h = $\kappa$/we is formed on top and travels upwards at a mean velocity we ≃ 0.1($\kappa$ |bs|$\chi$c2)1/3, where $\kappa$ is the mixture-fraction diffusivity, bs {\textless} 0 is the buoyancy anomaly at saturation conditions $\chi$s and $\chi$c is the cross-over mixture fraction defining the interval of buoyancy reversing mixtures. A turbulent convection layer develops below and continuously broadens into the cloud (the lower saturated fluid). This turbulent layer approaches a self-preserving state that is characterized by the convection scales constructed from a constant reference buoyancy flux Bs = |bs|we/$\chi$s. Right underneath the inversion base, a transition or buffer zone is defined based on a strong local conversion of vertical to horizontal motion that leads to a cellular pattern and sheet-like plumes, as observed in cloud measurements and reported in other free-convection problems. The fluctuating saturation surface (instantaneous cloud top) is contained inside this intermediate region. Results show that the inversion is not broken due to the turbulent convection generated by the evaporative cooling, and the upward mean entrainment velocity we is negligibly small compared to the convection velocity scale w* of the turbulent layer and the corresponding growth rate into the cloud.},

abstract = {Surface nanobubbles are experimentally known to survive for days at hydrophobic surfaces immersed in gas-oversaturated water. This is different from bulk nanobubbles, which are pressed out by the Laplace pressure against any gas oversaturation and dissolve in submilliseconds, as derived by Epstein and Plesset [J. Chem. Phys. 18, 1505 (1950)]. Pinning of the contact line has been speculated to be the reason for the stability of the surface nanobubbles. Building on an exact result by Popov [Phys. Rev. E 71, 036313 (2005)] on coffee stain evaporation, here we confirm this speculation by an exact calculation for single surface nanobubbles. It is based only on (i) the diffusion equation, (ii) Laplace pressure, and (iii) Henry's equation, i.e., fluid dynamical equations which are all known to be valid down to the nanometer scale. The crucial parameter is the gas oversaturation $\zeta$ of the liquid. At the stable equilibrium, the gas overpressures due to this oversaturation and the Laplace pressure balance. The theory predicts how the contact angle of the pinned bubble depends on $\zeta$ and the surface nanobubble's footprint lateral extension L. It also predicts an upper lateral extension threshold for stable surface nanobubbles to exist.},

Apart from the anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the flow, insufficiently high Rayleigh numbers, and intermittency corrections (which all hinder the identification of such a potential regime), there are also reasons, as a matter of principle, why such a scaling regime may be limited to at most a decade, namely the lack of clear scale separation between the Bolgiano length scale LB and the height of the cell.},

Square-stud roughness elements have been added on the bottom plate of a rectangular Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard cell in air, to trigger instabilities in the boundary layers. The top plate is kept smooth.

The very large size of the Barrel of Ilmenau allows detailed velocity fields to be obtained using particle image velocimetry very close to the roughness elements. We found that the flow is quite different at low Rayleigh numbers, where there is no heat-transfer enhancement, and at high Rayleigh numbers where there is a heat-transfer enhancement due to the roughness. Below the transition, the fluid inside the notch, i.e. between the studs, is essentially at rest, though it is slowly recirculating. The velocity profiles on the top of obstacles and in grooves are fairly compatible with those obtained in the smooth case. Above the transition, on the other hand, we observe large incursions of the bulk inside the notch, and the velocity profiles on the top of obstacles are closer to the logarithmic profiles expected in the case of turbulent boundary layers. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of a cooling air–water interface were employed to determine the structure of the temperature, velocity, and vorticity fields in the thin thermal boundary layer formed at the free surface. The simulations were performed at low to moderate Rayleigh numbers. In this flow, the turbulence is initiated by the Rayleigh instability at the interface and is maintained by buoyant production. Visualizations of the flow reveal that the temperature field at the interface is composed of large warm patches surrounded by cooler dense fluid which accumulates in thin bands. The cool fluid associated with the bands initially falls in sheets, but rapidly forms descending tubes and plumes. The turbulence statistics were scaled both with outer and inner variables. The latter scaling is based on the so-called surface strain model which is essentially consistent with Townsend's inner scaling. It is found that the temperature statistics collapse well using inner variables. On the other hand, the vertical velocity scales well with inner variables within the thermal boundary layer, but at greater depths it becomes more appropriate to use outer scaling. The anisotropic nature of the velocity statistics in the core of the flow is ascribed to the relatively low Rayleigh numbers used in the simulations. An explanation for this anisotropy is offered based on a detailed examination of the turbulence kinetic energy balances.},

The irreversible mixing is largely confined to the unstable boundary layer, its rate exactly equal to the generation of available potential energy by the boundary fluxes, and mixing efficiency is 50{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of horizontal convection is reported for a large Rayleigh number, Ra similar to O(10(12)), and boundary conditions that allow comparison with previous laboratory experiments. The convection is forced by heating over half of the horizontal base of a long channel and cooling over the other half of the base. The solutions are consistent with the experiments, including small-scale streamwise roll instability developing into a convectively mixed layer within the bottom thermal boundary layer, and a turbulent endwall plume. The mechanical energy budget is shown to be dominated by conversions of available potential energy to kinetic energy by buoyancy flux in the plume and the reverse in the interior of the circulation. These local conversions are three orders of magnitude greater than the total rate of viscous dissipation. The total irreversible mixing is exactly equal to the generation of available potential energy by buoyancy forcing, and one order of magnitude larger than the viscous dissipation. This confirms that dissipation rate is not an indicator of the strength of the circulation and explains why horizontal convection is more energetic than might be expected.},

abstract = {Convection of an internally heated fluid, confined between top and bottom plates of equal temperature, is studied by direct numerical simulation in two and three dimensions. The unstably stratified upper region drives convection that penetrates into the stably stratified lower region. The fraction of produced heat escaping across the bottom plate, which is one half without convection, initially decreases as convection strengthens. Entering the turbulent regime, this decrease reverses in two dimensions but continues monotonically in three dimensions. The mean fluid temperature, which grows proportionally to the heating rate ({\$}H{\$}) without convection, grows proportionally to {\$}H{\^{}}{\{}4/5{\}}{\$} when convection is strong in both two and three dimensions. The ratio of the heating rate to the fluid temperature is likened to the Nusselt number of Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'enard convection.

abstract = {Recent results have shown that convection forced by a temperature gradient along one horizontal boundary of a rectangular domain at a large Rayleigh number can be turbulent in parts of the flow field. However, the conditions for onset of turbulence, the dependence of flow and heat transport on Rayleigh number, and the roles of large and small scales in the flow, have not been established. We use three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES) over a wide range of Rayleigh numbers, Ra ∼ 10 8 –10 15 , for Prandtl number Pr = 5 and a small aspect ratio, and show that a sequence of several stability transitions at Ra ∼ 10 10 –10 11 defines a change from laminar to turbulent flow. The Prandtl number dependence too is examined at Ra = 5.86 × 10 11 . At the smallest Ra considered the thermal boundary layer is characterized by a balance of viscous stress and buoyancy, whereas inertia and buoyancy dominate in the large-Ra regime. The change in the momentum balance is accompanied by turbulent enhancement of the overall heat transfer, although both laminar and turbulent regimes give Nu ∼ Ra 1/5 . The results support both viscous and inviscid theoretical scaling models from previous work. The mechanical energy budget for an intermediate range of Rayleigh numbers above onset of instability (10 10 {\textless} Ra {\textless} 10 13) reveals that the small scales of motion are produced predominantly by thermal convection, whereas at Ra 10 14 shear instability of the large-scale flow begins to play a dominant role in sustaining the small-scale turbulence. Extrapolation to ocean conditions requires knowledge of the inertial regime identified here, but the simulations show that the corresponding asymptotic balance has not been fully realized by Ra ∼ 10 15 .},

abstract = {Efficient solution of the Navier-Stokes equations in complex domains is dependent upon the availability of fast solvers for sparse linear systems. For unsteady incompressible flows, the pressure operator is the leading contributor to stiffness, as the characteristic propagation speed is infinite. In the context of operator splitting formulations, it is the pressure solve which is the most computationally challenging, despite its elliptic origins. We examine several preconditioners for the consistent L-2 Poisson operator arising in the P-N - PN-2 spectral element formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We develop a finite element-based additive Schwarz preconditioner using overlapping subdomains plus a coarse grid projection operator which is applied directly to the pressure on the interior Gauss points. For large two-dimensional problems this approach can yield as much as a fivefold reduction in simulation time over previously employed methods based upon deflation. (C) 1997 Academic Press.},

abstract = {A second-order accurate, highly efficient method is developed for simulating unsteady three-dimensional incompressible flows in complex geometries. This is achieved by using boundary body forces that allow the imposition of the boundary conditions on a given surface not coinciding with the computational grid. The governing equations, therefore, can be discretized and solved on a regular mesh thus retaining the advantages and the efficiency of the standard solution procedures. Two different forcings are tested showing that while the quality of the results is essentially the same in both cases, the efficiency of the calculation strongly depends on the particular expression. A major issue is the interpolation of the forcing over the grid that determines the accuracy of the scheme; this ranges from zeroth-order for the most commonly used interpolations up to second-order for an ad hoc velocity interpolation. The present scheme has been used to simulate several flows whose results have been validated by experiments and other results available in the literature. Finally in the last example we show the flow inside an IC piston/cylinder assembly at high Reynolds number; to our knowledge this is the first example in which the immersed boundary technique is applied to a full three-dimensional complex flow with moving boundaries and with a Reynolds number high enough to require a subgrid-scale turbulence model. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.At the crossroad between flow topology analysis and the theory of turbulence, a new eddy-viscosity model for Large-eddy simulation has been recently proposed by Trias et al.[PoF, 27, 065103 (2015)]. The S3PQR-model has the proper cubic near-wall behaviour and no intrinsic limitations for statistically inhomogeneous flows. In this work, the new model has been tested for an air turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection in a rectangular cell of aspect ratio unity and n span-wise open-ended distance. To do so, direct numerical simulation has been carried out at two Rayleigh numbers Ra = 108 and 1010, to assess the model performance and investigate a priori the effect of the turbulent Prandtl number. Using an approximate formula based on the Taylor series expansion, the turbulent Prandtl number has been calculated and revealed a constant and Ra-independent value across the bulk region equals to 0.55. It is found that the turbulent components of eddy-viscosity and eddy-diffusivity are positively prevalent to maintain a turbulent wind essentially driven by the mean buoyant force at the sidewalls. On the other hand, the new eddy-viscosity model is preliminary tested for the case of Ra = 108 and showed overestimation of heat flux within the boundary layer but fairly good prediction of turbulent kinetics at this moderate turbulent flow.},

@article{Clercx2017,
abstract = {Since the seminal article “Inertial ranges in two-dimensional turbulence” by Kraichnan in 1967, our understanding of the dynamics and transport properties of two-dimensional turbulence is largely built on the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy of statistically steady or decaying turbulence. In the last two decades, more attention has been paid to the presence of lateral walls, either with stress-free or no-slip boundary conditions, and also considering a variety of geometries such as square, rectangular, or circular domains. The impact of confining boundaries on the dynamics of two-dimensional turbulence is important. This is in sharp contrast with three-dimensional turbulence, where homogeneity and isotropy are locally restored due to the cascade process in the inertial range. The impact of confining boundaries is therefore limited in three-dimensional turbulence. The presence of an inverse energy cascade in two-dimensional turbulence, however, will continuously generate large-scale energy-containing eddies, and their vigorous interaction with, in particular, no-slip walls generates large amounts of vorticity and contributes significantly to the dissipation of kinetic energy of the flow. The dissipation is even strongly enhanced compared with the unbounded case. In this review, we will focus on one of the elementary structures observed in two-dimensional turbulent flows: the dipolar vortex.With its self-induced velocity, it propagates easily through the domain and is hence likely to interact with domain boundaries. Standard vortex generation mechanisms allow to create well-defined dipoles and to investigate the collision of such structures with rigid domain boundaries in detail. Relevant aspects of the collision process concern the dynamics and stability of the generated boundary layers, the vorticity, and vorticity gradients contained in these boundary layers, and the dissipation of kinetic energy when dipoles collide with walls. Some of these aspects will be discussed in this review. Moreover, we are interested in the Reynolds-number dependence of these processes, including exploration of the vanishing viscosity limit.},

abstract = {Turbulent thermal convection is a well-studied problem with various issues of interest. In this paper, we review our work which shows the nature and origin of anomalous scaling and heat transport in the limit of very strong thermal forcing, can be gained by studying a dynamical model, known as shell model, of homogeneous turbulent thermal convection in which buoyancy acts directly at most scales. Specifically, we have obtained two results. The first result is that when buoyancy acts directly at most scales such that the dynamics are governed by a cascade of entropy, the scaling behavior is described by Bolgiano and Obukhov scaling plus corrections that are due to the variations of the local entropy transfer rate. This result indicates the validity of the extension of refined similarity hypothesis to turbulent thermal convection. The second result is that when buoyancy is acting directly at most scales, a damping term acting on the largest scale, which has to be added for the system to achieve stationarity, plays a crucial role in heat transport, and that the heat transport depends on the strength of thermal forcing in the same manner as that predicted for the ultimate state of very strong thermal forcing. With our interpretation of the damping term representing the effect of the boundaries, this result indicates that in the ultimate state of turbulent thermal convection, when buoyancy is acting at most scales, boundaries would play a significant role in heat transport. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

These conditional structure functions have power-law dependence on the value of the locally averaged thermal dissipation rate, and such dependence for the Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling is different from the other scaling behaviors. Our analysis of experimental measurements verifies the power-law dependence and reveals the Bolgiano-Obukhov scaling behavior at the center of the bottom plate of the convection cell.},

abstract = {It was recently discovered that a partitioned Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection (PRBC) by vertical adiabatic boards leaving a narrow horizontal channel (HC) open between partition boards and the cooling/heating plates, may remarkably enhance the overall heat transfer (Bao et al., 2015). This phenomenon is thoroughly investigated by both numerical and analytic study. Numerically, we perform a series of two-dimensional (2-D) direct numerical simulations (DNS) of PRBC for the same set of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers (Ra=1×108,Pr=0.7and5.3) and two aspect ratios ($\Gamma$=1 and 5). The DNS confirm that when the number of partition boards n is large enough, the flow in PRBC becomes coherent and laminar, and the wall jet in HC forms a thinner thermal boundary layer and hence enhances the heat flux from/to conducting plates. A thermosiphoning mode (TS-mode) is used to characterize this laminar forced convection state, which yields an analytic description of the relation between geometrical parameters and the heat transfer coefficient, including two asymptotes for small and large board-to-plate spacing d, where the Nusselt number (Nu) varies with d as d3and d-1, respectively. The analytical model then predicts an optimal partition spacing maximizing the heat transport, in good agreement with the DNS. More interestingly, the model yields an optimal width of the vertical channel (VC) between two partition boards, in the range 0.01⩽s/H⩽1.00 for $\Gamma$=1, as also validated by DNS. For large VC width, we develop a convection-adaptive (CA) model describing the interplay between turbulent bulk flow in VC and the TS-mode, which yields a prediction of Nu in close agreement with DNS for a wide range of n (n=0–35 for $\Gamma$=5). Therefore, we have developed an analytic understanding of the PRBC enhanced heat transfer, which provides useful relations for engineering design in industrial applications.},

Explicit formulae for the associated longitudinal and transverse effective slip lengths are derived; these are then compared with analogous results for superhydrophobic surfaces of the same characteristic geometry but where the menisci are shear-free.

For both boundary conditions the flow is dominated by fingers and the global responses follow the same scaling laws, with enhanced prefactors for the free-slip cases. Therefore, the laboratory experiments with the no-slip boundaries serve as a good model for the finger layers in the ocean. Moreover, in the free-slip case although the tangential shear stress is eliminated at the boundaries, the local dissipation rate in the near-wall region may exceed the value found in the no-slip cases, which is caused by the stronger vertical motions of fingers and sheet structures near the free-slip boundaries. This counter intuitive result might be relevant for properly estimating and modelling the mixing and entrainment phenomena at free-surfaces and interfaces.},

abstract = {We report on experimental determinations of the temperature field in the interior (bulk) of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection for a cylindrical sample with an aspect ratio (diameter D over height L) equal to 0.50, in both the classical and the ultimate state. The measurements are for Rayleigh numbers Ra from 6 x 10(11) to 10(13) in the classical and 7 x 10(14) to 1.1 x 10(15) (our maximum accessible Ra) in the ultimate state. The Prandtl number was close to 0.8. Although to lowest order the bulk is often assumed to be isothermal in the time average, we found a 'logarithmic layer' (as reported briefly by Ahlers et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 109, 2012, 114501) in which the reduced temperature Theta = [{\textless} T-(z) - T-m]/Delta T (with T-m the mean temperature, Delta T the applied temperature difference and {\textless}...{\textgreater} a time average) varies as A ln (z/L) + B or A' ln (1 - z/L + B' with the distance z from the bottom plate of the sample. In the classical state, the amplitudes -A and A' are equal within our resolution, while in the ultimate state there is a small difference, with -A/A' similar or equal to 0.95. For the classical state, the width of the log layer is approximately 0.1L, the same near the top and the bottom plate as expected for a system with reflection symmetry about its horizontal midplane. For the ultimate state, the log-layer width is larger, extending through most of the sample, and slightly asymmetric about the midplane. Both amplitudes A and A' vary with radial position r, and this variation can be described well by A = A(0) [(R - r)/R](-0.65), where R is the radius of the sample. In the classical state, these results are in good agreement with direct numerical simulations (DNS) for Ra = 2 x 10(12); in the ultimate state there are as yet no DNS. The amplitudes -A and A' varied as Ra-eta, with eta similar or equal to 0.12 in the classical and eta similar or equal to 0.18 in the ultimate state. A close analogy between the temperature field in the classical state and the 'law of the wall' for the time-averaged downstream velocity in shear flow is discussed. A two-sublayer mean-field model of the temperature profile in the classical state was analysed and yielded a logarithmic z dependence of Theta. The Ra dependence of the amplitude A given by the model corresponds to an exponent eta(th) D 0.106, in good agreement with the experiment. In the ultimate state the experimental result eta similar or equal to 0.18 differs from the prediction eta(th) similar or equal to 0.043 by Grossmann {\&} Lohse (Phys. Fluids, vol. 24, 2012, 125103).},

We used two cylindrical samples of different overall sizes, but each with its diameter nearly equal to its height. The fluid was water with a Prandtl number of 4.38. The time series theta{\_}0(t) consisted of meanderings similar to a diffusive process, but in addition contained large and irregular spontaneous reorientation events through angles Delta theta. We found that reorientations can occur by two distinct mechanisms. One consists of a rotation of the circulation plane without any major reduction of the circulation strength. The other involves a cessation of the circulation, followed by a restart in a randomly chosen new direction. Rotations occurred an order of magnitude more frequently than cessations. Rotations occurred with a monotonically decreasing probability distribution p(Delta theta), i.e. there was no dominant value of Delta theta and small Delta theta were more common than large ones. For cessations p(Delta theta) was uniform, suggesting that information of theta{\_}0(t) before the cessation is lost. Both rotations and cessations have Poissonian statistics in time, and can occur at any theta{\_}0. The average azimuthal rotation rate increased as the circulation strength of the LSC decreased. Tilting the sample relative to gravity significantly reduced the frequency of occurrence of both rotations and cessations.},

abstract = {For measurements of turbulent heat transport in Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection the correction for the sidewall conductance is usually neglected or based on measurements or estimates for the empty cell. It is argued that the lateral thermal coupling between the fluid and the wall can invalidate these approaches, and that corrections based on calculations of the two-dimensional temperature fields are required in some cases. These corrections can increase gamma obtained from fits of N=N(0)Rgamma (R is the Rayleigh number) to the Nusselt number N(R) by 0.02 or more, yielding values in the range 0.30 to 0.33, which are larger than most theoretical predictions.},

It consists of two physically motivated stochastic ordinary differential equations, one each for the strength and the azimuthal orientation of the LSC. Stochastic forces represent phenomenologically the influence of turbulent fluctuations.

abstract = {Experimental measurements of properties of the large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent convection of a fluid heated from below in a cylindrical container of aspect ratio one are presented and used to test a model of diffusion in a potential well for the LSC. The model consists of a pair of stochastic ordinary differential equations motivated by the Navier-Stokes equations. The two coupled equations are for the azimuthal orientation theta{\_}0, and for the azimuthal temperature amplitude delta at the horizontal midplane. The dynamics is due to the driving by Gaussian distributed white noise that is introduced to represent the action of the small-scale turbulent fluctuations on the large-scale flow. Measurements of the diffusivities that determine the noise intensities are reported. Two time scales predicted by the model are found to be within a factor of two or so of corresponding experimental measurements. A scaling relationship predicted by the model between delta and the Reynolds number is confirmed by measurements over a large experimental parameter range. The Gaussian peaks of probability distributions p(delta) and p($\backslash$dot$\backslash$theta{\_}0) are accurately described by the model; however the non-Gaussian tails of p(delta) are not. The frequency, angular change, and amplitude bahavior during cessations are accurately described by the model when the tails of the probability distribution of {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} are used as experimental input.},

abstract = {Previously we published a dynamical model (E. Brown and G. Ahlers, Phys. Fluids, 20, 075101 (2008)) for the large-scale-circulation (LSC) dynamics of Rayleigh-Benard convection in cylindrical containers. The model consists of a pair of stochastic ordinary differential equations, motivated by the Navier-Stokes equations, one each for the strength delta and the orientation theta{\_}0 of the LSC. Here we extend it to cases where the rotational invariance of the system is broken by one of several physically relevant perturbations. As an example we present experimental measurements of the LSC dynamics for a container tilted relative to gravity. In that case the model predicts that the buoyancy of the thermal boundary layers encourages fluid to travel along the steepest slope, that it locks the LSC in this direction, and that it strengthens the flow, as seen in experiments. The increase in LSC strength is shown to be responsible for the observed suppression of cessations and azimuthal fluctuations. We predict and observe that for large enough tilt angles, the restoring force that aligns the flow with the slope is strong enough to cause oscillations of the LSC around this orientation. This planar oscillation mode is different from coherent torsional oscillations that have been observed previously. The model was applied also to containers with elliptical cross-sections and predicts that the pressure due to the side walls forces the flow into a preferred orientation in the direction of the longest diameter. When the ellipticity is large enough, then oscillations around this orientation are predicted.},

For cylindrical samples of aspect ratio $\Gamma$ =1 the mode consists of an azimuthal twist of the near-vertical LSC circulation plane, with the top and bottom halves of the plane oscillating out of phase by half a cycle. The data for $\Gamma$ =1 and $\sigma$ =4.4 showed that the oscillation amplitude varied irregularly in time, yielding a Gaussian probability distribution centred at zero for the displacement angle. This result can be described well by the equation of motion of a stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillator. It suggests that the existence of the oscillations is a consequence of the stochastic driving by the small-scale turbulent background fluctuations of the system, rather than a consequence of a Hopf bifurcation of the deterministic system. The power spectrum of the LSC orientation had a peak at finite frequency with a quality factor Q?5, nearly independent of R. For samples with $\Gamma$ b 2 we did not find this mode, but there remained a characteristic periodic signal that was detectable in the area density $\rho$p of the plumes above the bottom-plate centre. Measurements of $\rho$p revealed a strong dependence on the Rayleigh number R, and on the aspect ratio $\Gamma$ that could be represented by $\rho$p ∼ $\Gamma$ 2.7±0.3.Moviesare available with the online version of the paper.},

A filtering method discriminates these two regimes and allows us to identify two characteristic time scales for the former regime. A time rescaling is then used to tune our records to a common duration, thus putting into evidence a generic reversal cycle. This cycle is composed of three successive phases: acceleration, accumulation and release including a rebound event. We complement this view in terms of a global angular impulse, available mechanical energy, global kinetic energy and their corresponding transfer rates. For a particular realisation of a reversal, each phase is described in terms of the flow patterns (large diagonal roll, counter-rotating corner flows and thermal plumes) and tied to the corresponding energy processes. We conclude by performing linear as well as nonlinear stability studies to account for the triggering mechanism of the release. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Despite being ubiquitous, the influence of temporal modulations (with frequency {\$}f{\$}) on global transport properties has hardly been studied.

Using the concept of Stokes thermal boundary layer, we can explain the onset frequency of the Nu enhancement and the optimal frequency at which Nu is maximal, and how they depend on the Rayleigh number Ra and Prandtl number {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Pr{\}}{\$}. From this, we construct a phase diagram in the 3D parameter space ({\$}f{\$}, {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Ra{\}}{\$}, {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Pr{\}}{\$}) and identify: (i) a regime where the modulation is too fast to affect {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Nu{\}}{\$}; (ii) a moderate modulation regime, where {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Nu{\}}{\$} increases with decreasing {\$}f{\$} and (iii) slow modulation regime, where {\$}\backslashrm{\{}Nu{\}}{\$} decreases with further decreasing {\$}f{\$}.

abstract = {In this paper we analyze transitional regimes and mean flow structures for the thermally driven convective flow in a cylindrical cell of aspect-ratio (diameter over cell height) $\Gamma$ = 1 / 2. The investigation is carried out through the numerical integration of the three-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation. In particular the critical Rayleigh numbers for the onset of convection, for the unsteady, chaotic and turbulent regimes are computed for two values of the Prandtl number and comparisons with cylindrical cells of larger aspect-ratio are performed. The effect of the background rotation on the flow dynamics is also described showing that the heat transfer increase, already evidenced in the literature, is only obtained for a range of rotation rates. The rotation can enhance or inhibit the heat transfer and, at low Rayleigh numbers, it is a very effective way to inhibit vertical motions and to prevent horizontal thermal gradients. This is highly desirable in solidification and crystal growth processes where thermally induced motions cause material defects and crystal inhomogeneities. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {We investigate the transitions near the onset of thermal convection in electrically conducting low Prandtl-number (Pr) fluids in the presence of rotation about a vertical axis and external horizontal magnetic field. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNSs) and low dimensional modeling are performed with the Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard convection system in the ranges 0 {\textless} Q ≤ 1000 and 0 {\textless} Ta ≤ 500 of the Chandrasekhar number (Q) and the Taylor number (Ta), respectively, for that purpose. For larger Q(≥32.7), DNSs show substantial enhancement of convective heat transport and only finite amplitude steady two dimensional roll patterns at the onset. On the other hand, for smaller Q({\textless}32.7), very rich dynamics involving different stationary as well as time dependent patterns, including stationary two-dimensional rolls, cross rolls, and oscillatory cross rolls, are observed at the onset of convection. Our investigation uncovers the cause of enhancement of heat transport and the origin of different flow patterns at the onset. We establish that a first order transition to convection occurring at the onset is responsible for the enhancement of the heat transport there. Furthermore, as the Rayleigh number (Ra) is increased beyond the onset, subsequent transitions near it are also explored in detail for smaller Q, and these are found to be associated with a variety of bifurcations including subcritical/supercritical pitchfork, Hopf, imperfect pitchfork, imperfect gluing, and Neimark-Sacker.},

We show that the zonal flows in diffusion dominated regimes are driven purely by the Reynolds stresses, always travelling retrograde, while in convection dominated regimes, mean flow advection, caused by tilted convection cells, becomes dominant, which generally leads to prograde mean zonal flows. By means of direct numerical simulations we validate theoretical predictions made for the diffusion dominated regime. Furthermore, we make use of the linear stability analysis and explain the existence of the tilted convection cell mode. Our extensive 3D simulations support the results for 2D flows and thus confirm the relevance of the findings for geopyhsical and astrophysical systems.},

abstract = {Existing experimental and numerical data suggest that the turbulence energy dissipation and enstrophy (i.e., the square of vorticity) possess different scaling properties, while available theory suggests that there should be no differences at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. We have performed a series of direct numerical simulations with up to 20483 grid points where advanced computational power is used to increase the Reynolds number (up to 650 on the Taylor scale) or to resolve the small scales better (down to 1/4 of a Kolmogorov scale). Our primary goal is to assess the differences and similarities between dissipation and enstrophy. Special attention is paid to the effects of small-scale resolution on the quality and reliability of the data, in view of recent theoretical work [V. Yakhot and K. R. Sreenivasan, "Anomalous scaling of structure functions and dynamic constraints on turbulence simulations," J. Stat. Phys. 121, 823 (2005)] which stipulates the resolution needed to obtain a moment of a given order.We also provide error estimates as a function of small-scale resolution. Probability density functions of dissipation and enstrophy at high Reynolds number reveal the presence of extreme events several thousands times of the mean. The extreme events in dissipation and enstrophy fields appear to scale alike, substantially overlap in space, and are nearly statistically isotropic, while fluctuations of moderate amplitudes, at least for the present Reynolds numbers, show persistent differences. Conditional sampling shows that intense dissipation is likely to be accompanied by similarly intense enstrophy, but intense enstrophy is not always accompanied by intense dissipation. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = { The effect of Prandtl number on the dynamics of a convective turbulent flow is studied by numerical experiments. In particular, three series of experiments have been performed; in two of them the Rayleigh number spanned about two decades while the Prandtl number was set equal to 0.022 (mercury) and 0.7 (air). In the third series, in contrast, we fixed the Rayleigh number at 6×10 5 and the Prandtl number was varied from 0.0022 up to 15. The results have shown that, depending on the Prandtl number, there are two distinct flow regimes; in the first ( Pr [lsim ]0.35) the flow is dominated by the large-scale recirculation cell that is the most important ‘engine' for heat transfer. In the second regime, on the other hand, the large-scale flow plays a negligible role in the heat transfer which is mainly transported by the thermal plumes.  For the low- Pr regime a model for the heat transfer is derived and the predictions are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of the numerical simulations and of the experiments. All the hypotheses and the consequences of the model are directly checked and all the findings are consistent with the predictions and with experimental observations performed under similar conditions. Finally, in order to stress the effects of the large-scale flow some counter examples are shown in which the large-scale motion is artificially suppressed. },

Our work represents a first approach to synthesize four-dimensional physics fields with neural networks. Based on a conditional generative adversarial network that is designed for the inference of three-dimensional volumetric data, our model generates consistent and detailed results by using a novel temporal discriminator, in addition to the commonly used spatial one. Our experiments show that the generator is able to infer more realistic high-resolution details by using additional physical quantities, such as low-resolution velocities or vorticities. Besides improvements in the training process and in the generated outputs, these inputs offer means for artistic control as well. We additionally employ a physics-aware data augmentation step, which is crucial to avoid overfitting and to reduce memory requirements. In this way, our network learns to generate advected quantities with highly detailed, realistic, and temporally coherent features. Our method works instantaneously, using only a single time-step of low-resolution fluid data. We demonstrate the abilities of our method using a variety of complex inputs and applications in two and three dimensions.},

abstract = {Turbulent flows in nature and technology possess a range of scales. The largest scales carry the memory of the physical system in which a flow is embedded. One challenge is to unravel the universal statistical properties that all turbulent flows share despite their different large-scale driving mechanisms or their particular flow geometries. In the present work, we study three turbulent flows of systematically increasing complexity. These are homogeneous and isotropic turbulence in a periodic box, turbulent shear flow between two parallel walls, and thermal convection in a closed cylindrical container. They are computed by highly resolved direct numerical simulations of the governing dynamical equations. We use these simulation data to establish two fundamental results: (i) at Reynolds numbers Re ∼ 10(2) the fluctuations of the velocity derivatives pass through a transition from nearly Gaussian (or slightly sub-Gaussian) to intermittent behavior that is characteristic of fully developed high Reynolds number turbulence, and (ii) beyond the transition point, the statistics of the rate of energy dissipation in all three flows obey the same Reynolds number power laws derived for homogeneous turbulence. These results allow us to claim universality of small scales even at low Reynolds numbers. Our results shed new light on the notion of when the turbulence is fully developed at the small scales without relying on the existence of an extended inertial range.},

Multiple crossing ultrasound beam lines and an array of thermocouples at mid-height allow for a detailed analysis and characterization of the complex three-dimensional dynamics of the single large-scale circulation (LSC) roll in the cylindrical convection cell of unit aspect ratio which is filled with the liquid metal alloy GaInSn. We measure the internal temporal correlations of the complex large-scale flow and distinguish between short-term oscillations associated with a sloshing motion in the mid-plane with varying orientation angles of the velocity close to the top/bottom plates and the slow azimuthal drift of the mean orientation of the roll as a whole that proceeds on a hundred times slower time scale. The coherent LSC drives a vigorous turbulence in the whole cell that is quantified by direct Reynolds number measurements at different locations in the cell. The velocity increment statistics in the bulk of the cell displays characteristic properties of intermittent small-scale fluid turbulence. We also show that the impact of the symmetry-breaking large-scale flow persists to small-scale velocity fluctuations thus preventing the establishment of isotropic turbulence in the cell centre. Reynolds number amplitudes depend sensitively on beam line position in the cell such that different definitions have to be compared. The global momentum and heat transfer scalings with Rayleigh number are found to agree with those of direct numerical simulations and other laboratory experiments.},

In the first chapter, six canonical models of convection are described: three configurations of IH convection driven by constant and uniform volumetric heating, and three configurations of RB convection driven by the boundary conditions. The IH models are distinguished by differing pairs of thermal boundary conditions: top and bottom boundaries of equal temperature, an insulating bottom with heat flux fixed at the top, and an insulating bottom with temperature fixed at the top. The RB models also are distinguished by whether temperatures or heat fluxes are fixed at the top and bottom boundaries. Integral quantities important to heat transport are discussed, including the mean fluid temperature, the mean temperature difference between the boundaries, and the mean convective heat transport. Integral relations and bounds are presented, and further bounds are conjectured for the IH cases. The second chapter presents results that can be derived mathematically from the governing equations: linear and nonlinear stability thresholds of static states, and parameter-dependent bounds. Known bounds are on mean temperatures in IH convection and on convective transport in RB convection. The third chapter reviews numerical simulations and laboratory experiments on IH convection, emphasizing quantitative results.},

We showed that the dominant Fourier modes in the 2D and 3D flows are very close. Consequently, the 3D RBC is quasi two-dimensional, which is the reason for the similarities between the 2D and 3D RBC for large- and infinite Prandtl numbers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Physical Society. In this paper we estimate the relative strengths of various terms of the Rayleigh-B{\'{e}}nard equations. Based on these estimates and scaling analysis, we derive a general formula for the large-scale velocity U or the P{\'{e}}clet number that is applicable for arbitrary Rayleigh number Ra and Prandtl number Pr. Our formula fits reasonably well with the earlier simulation and experimental results. Our analysis also shows that the wall-bounded convection has enhanced viscous force compared to free turbulence. We also demonstrate how correlations deviate the Nusselt number scaling from the theoretical prediction of Ra1/2 to the experimentally observed scaling of nearly Ra0.3.},

abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of turbulent convection for infinite Prandtl number with free-slip walls and study the dynamics of flow reversals. We show interesting correlations between the flow reversals and the nonlinear interactions among the large-scale flow structures represented by the modes (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and some others. After a flow reversal, the odd modes, e.g., (1,1) and (3,1), switch sign, but the even modes, e.g., (2,2), retain their sign. The mixed modes (1,2) and (2,1) fluctuate around zero. Using the properties of the modes and their interactions, we show that they form a Klein four-group Z2 × Z2. We also show that for the free-slip boundary condition, the corner rolls and vortex reconnection are absent during a flow reversal, in contrast to active role played by them in flow rever- sals for the no-slip boundary condition. We argue that the flow reversals with the no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions are different because they are induced by nonlinearities (u {\textperiodcentered} ∇)u and (u {\textperiodcentered} ∇)$\theta$, respectively.},

abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of free convection over a smooth, heated plate are used to investigate unbounded, unsteady turbulent convection. Four different boundary conditions are considered: free-slip or no-slip walls, and constant buoyancy or constant buoyancy flux. It is first shown that, after the initial transient, the vertical structure agrees with observations in the atmospheric boundary layer and predictions from classical similarity theory. A quasi-steady inner layer and a self-preserving outer layer are clearly distinguished, with an overlap region between them of constant turbulent buoyancy flux. The extension of the overlap region reached in our simulations is more than 100 wall units {\$} \backslashmathop (\backslashkappa {\^{}}3 / B{\_}s )\backslashnolimits {\^{}}1/ 4 {\$} , where {\$}B{\_}s {\$} is the surface buoyancy flux and {\$}\backslashkappa {\$} the corresponding molecular diffusivity (the Prandtl number is one). The buoyancy fluctuation inside the overlap region already exhibits the {\$}\backslashensuremath- 1/ 3{\$} power-law scaling with height for the four types of boundary conditions, as expected in the local, free-convection regime. However, the mean buoyancy gradient and the vertical velocity fluctuation are still evolving toward the corresponding power laws predicted by the similarity theory. The second major result is that the relation between the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers agrees with that reported in Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard convection when the heated plate is interpreted as half a convection cell. The range of Rayleigh numbers covered in the simulations is then {\$}5\backslashensuremath\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}7 \backslashtext\backslashndash 10{\^{}}9 {\$} . Further analogies between the two problems indicate that knowledge can be transferred between steady Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard and unsteady convection. Last, we find that the inner scaling based on {\$}{\{} B{\_}s , \backslashhspace0.167em \backslashkappa {\}} {\$} reduces the effect of the boundary conditions to, mainly, the diffusive wall layer, the first 10 wall units. There, near the plate, free-slip conditions allow stronger mixing than no-slip ones, which results in 30 {\%} less buoyancy difference between the surface and the overlap region and 30–40 {\%} thinner diffusive sublayers. However, this local effect also entails one global, substantial effect: with an imposed buoyancy, free-slip systems develop a surface flux 60 {\%} higher than that obtained with no-slip walls, which implies more intense turbulent fluctuations across the whole boundary layer and a faster growth.},

This sloshing mode, together with the torsional mode of the LSC, are found to be the origin of the oscillation of the temperature field.},

abstract = {In this article the principles of the field operation and manipulation (FOAM) C++class library for continuum mechanics are outlined. Our intention is to make it as easy as possible to develop reliable and efficient computational continuum-mechanics codes: this is achieved by making the top-level syntax of the code as close as possible to conventional mathematical notation for tensors and partial differential equations. Object-orientation techniques enable the creation of data types that closely mimic those of continuum mechanics, and the operator overloading possible in C++ allows normal mathematical symbols to be used for the basic operations. As an example, the implementation of various types of turbulence modeling in a FOAM computational-fluid-dynamics code is discussed, and calculations performed on a standard test case, that of flow around a square prism, are presented. To demonstrate the flexibility of the FOAM library, codes for solving structures and magnetohydrodynamics are also presented with appropriate test case results given.},

abstract = {Computational codes for direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh–B{\'{e}}nard (RB) convection are compared in terms of computational cost and quality of the solution. As a benchmark case, RB convection at Ra=108and Pr=1 in a periodic domain, in cubic and cylindrical containers is considered. A dedicated second-order finite-difference code (AFID/RBFLOW) and a specialized fourth-order finite-volume code (GOLDFISH) are compared with a general purpose finite-volume approach (OPENFOAM) and a general purpose spectral-element code (NEK5000). Reassuringly, all codes provide predictions of the average heat transfer that converge to the same values. The computational costs, however, are found to differ considerably. The specialized codes AFID/RBFLOW and GOLDFISH are found to excel in efficiency, outperforming the general purpose flow solvers NEK5000 and OPENFOAM by an order of magnitude with an error on the Nusselt number Nu below 5{\%}. However, we find that Nu alone is not sufficient to assess the quality of the numerical results: in fact, instantaneous snapshots of the temperature field from a near wall region obtained for deliberately under-resolved simulations using NEK5000 clearly indicate inadequate flow resolution even when Nu is converged. Overall, dedicated special purpose codes for RB convection are found to be more efficient than general purpose codes.},

abstract = {We discuss two aspects of turbulent Rayleigh-B$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}nard convection (RBC) on the basis of high-resolution direct numerical simulations in a unique setting; a closed cylindrical cell of aspect ratio of one. First, we present a comprehensive comparison of statistical quantities such as energy dissipation rates and boundary layer thickness scales. Data are used from three simulation run series at Prandtl numbers {\$}Pr{\$} that cover two orders of magnitude. In contrast to most previous studies in RBC the focus of the present work is on convective turbulence at very low Prandtl numbers including {\$}Pr=0.021{\$} for liquid mercury or gallium and {\$}Pr=0.005{\$} for liquid sodium. In this parameter range of RBC, inertial effects cause a dominating turbulent momentum transport that is in line with highly intermittent fluid turbulence both in the bulk and in the boundary layers and thus should be able to trigger a transition to the fully turbulent boundary layers of the ultimate regime of convection for higher Rayleigh number. Secondly, we predict the ranges of Rayleigh numbers for which the viscous boundary layer will transition to turbulence and the flow as a whole will cross over into the ultimate regime. These transition ranges are obtained by extrapolation from our simulation data. The extrapolation methods are based on the large-scale properties of the velocity profile. Two of the three methods predict similar ranges for the transition to ultimate convection when their uncertainties are taken into account. All three extrapolation methods indicate that the range of critical Rayleigh numbers {\$}Ra{\_}c{\$} is shifted to smaller magnitudes as the Prandtl number becomes smaller.},

@article{Schumacher2015,
abstract = {Turbulent convection is often present in liquids with a kinematic viscosity much smaller than the diffusivity of the temperature. Here we reveal why these convection flows obey a much stronger level of fluid turbulence than those in which kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity are the same; i.e., the Prandtl number Pr is unity. We compare turbulent convection in air at Pr=0.7 and in liquid mercury at Pr=0.021. In this comparison the Prandtl number at constant Grashof number Gr is varied, rather than at constant Rayleigh number Ra as usually done. Our simulations demonstrate that the turbulent Kolmogorov-like cascade is extended both at the large- and small-scale ends with decreasing Pr. The kinetic energy injection into the flow takes place over the whole cascade range. In contrast to convection in air, the kinetic energy injection rate is particularly enhanced for liquid mercury for all scales larger than the characteristic width of thermal plumes. As a consequence, mean values and fluctuations of the local strain rates are increased, which in turn results in significantly enhanced enstrophy production by vortex stretching. The normalized distributions of enstrophy production in the bulk and the ratio of the principal strain rates are found to agree for both Prs. Despite the different energy injection mechanisms, the principal strain rates also agree with those in homogeneous isotropic turbulence conducted at the same Reynolds numbers as for the convection flows. Our results have thus interesting implications for small-scale turbulence modeling of liquid metal convection in astrophysical and technological applications.},
